<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sink or Swim</span>” is the second volume of
the “<span class="smcap">Luck and Pluck Series</span>,” and, like its
predecessor, is designed to illustrate the truth
that a manly spirit is better than the gifts of
fortune.</p>

<p>It does not fall to the lot of many boys to
meet with such adventures or to encounter such
trials as befell the young hero of this story; but
it will be of service to all, to adopt Harry Raymond’s
motto. If there are any of my young
readers who are disposed to envy Harry’s final
good fortune, let them remember that the best
way to strive for success is to deserve it; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
then, if it does not come, there will at least be
a consciousness of well-doing, which in itself is
a rich reward.</p>

<h1>SINK OR SWIM;<br />
<span class="smaller">OR,</span><br />
HARRY RAYMOND’S RESOLVE.</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE VERNON HIGH SCHOOL.</span></h2>

<p>“Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I
give my hand and my heart to this vote.”</p>

<p>These words were declaimed in a clear, ringing
voice from the platform of the Vernon High School.
The speaker was a boy of fifteen, well-knit, and vigorous,
with a frank, manly expression, and a prepossessing
face. His dark chestnut hair waved slightly
above a high, intellectual brow, and his attitude, as
he faced his school-mates, was one of ease and unconscious
grace. His eye flashed as he declaimed with
appropriate emphasis the patriotic extract which
commences in the well-known words quoted above.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
He had learned the orator’s secret,—to be in earnest,—and
he carried his audience with him. When,
at the conclusion of his declamation, he bowed and
walked to his desk, the boys broke into spontaneous
applause. Though this was contrary to the rules of
the school, Reuben Tower, A. M., the principal, uttered
no reprimand. He had himself been pleased
with the declamation, and sympathized to some
extent with the scholars.</p>

<p>“Very well indeed, Master Raymond! You speak
as if you felt it,” he said.</p>

<p>Harry Raymond looked gratified at this double
commendation. The applause of his school-mates
pleased him, for he was by no means indifferent to
their good opinion, which he tried on all occasions
to deserve. He was no less pleased with Mr.
Tower’s praise, for he had a high respect for his
ability, and that praise was never lightly bestowed.</p>

<p>I have spoken of Harry’s good appearance. I am
obliged to confess that his dress had nothing to do
with this. In fact, his jacket and pants were of very
coarse texture, and by no means elegant in fit. Besides
this, they appeared, though neat, to have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
considerable service, and there was a patch on one
knee,—very small, indeed, but still a patch. In fact,
I may as well state at the outset, that Harry was the
son of a house-carpenter,—an industrious and intelligent
man, but still of limited income, and obliged to
economize strictly in order to lay aside, as he made
it a point to do, a hundred dollars a year, as a provision
for the future.</p>

<p>The applause which followed our hero’s declamation
was almost unanimous. I say <em>almost</em>, for there
were two boys who did not join in it. One of these was
James Turner, a boy about Harry’s age, but more
slightly made. He was the son of Squire Turner,
the wealthiest man in Vernon, and his dress afforded
quite a contrast to the ill-fitting garments of our
young hero. The village tailor’s skill had not been
deemed sufficient, but James had accompanied his
father to New York, where his measure had been left
with a Broadway tailor, who had made up the suit
and sent it to Vernon by express. The cloth was
very fine, and there was a style and neatness of fit
about the clothes of which James felt very proud.
He regarded his companions with a supercilious air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
as if convinced of his own immeasurable superiority,
in dress at least.</p>

<p>James Turner did not participate in the applause
called forth by Harry Raymond’s declamation. On
the contrary, he sat with an unpleasant sneer on his
lips, and cast a glance of scorn at the patch, which
his quick eye had detected in our hero’s pants.</p>

<p>There was another boy, sitting next to James, who
also refrained from joining in the applause. This
was Tom Barton, a friend and hanger-on of James
Turner, who, by persistent flattery, earned the privilege
of being treated with half-contemptuous familiarity
and condescension by the young aristocrat. He
knew that James did not like Harry Raymond, and
the sneer which he saw on the lips of his patron gave
him the cue. He attempted to imitate it, and gaze
scornfully at the young orator in his momentary
triumph.</p>

<p>“James Turner!” called out the principal.</p>

<p>James Turner rose from his seat, and walked to the
platform, which he ascended, greeting the audience
with a stiff and consequential bow, and an air which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
might be interpreted to mean, “Boys, you will now
have the privilege of hearing <em>me</em> speak.”</p>

<p>James had selected a good piece,—Patrick
Henry’s well-known appeal to arms, familiar to every
school-boy, commencing, “I have but one lamp by
which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of
experience.”</p>

<p>It is a fine piece of oratory, lofty in tone and sentiment,
and should be spoken with dignified earnestness.
James Turner’s voice, which was shrill, was
scarcely calculated to do justice to it. Still it would
not have called out any demonstration from the
young auditory, but for one or two peculiar ideas on
the part of James, as to the proper way of speaking
it. When he came to the clause, “We have prostrated
ourselves before the throne,” he suited the
action to the word, and sank upon his knees. But,
afraid of soiling his pantaloons, he first spread out
his silk handkerchief on the platform, and this
spoiled whatever effect the action might otherwise
have had. There was a general titter, which the
young aristocrat saw with anger. At the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
sentence, he rose from his knees, and, with a general
scowl at the boys, kept on with his declamation.</p>

<p>But a more serious <i lang="fr">contretemps</i> awaited him. A
little further on, the orator says, “We have been
spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne.”
Here again, James, with a striking lack of judgment,
thought it would heighten the effect to suit the action
to the word. Accordingly, he prepared to kick out
with his right foot. Unfortunately, he was so
provoked with his school-mates, for their lack of
appreciation of the other point he had made, that he
executed the manœuvre, if it may properly be so
called, with a spiteful emphasis which was too much
for his equilibrium. He lost his balance, and fell
forward in a ludicrous manner, and rolled over on the
floor of the school-room.</p>

<p>It could not be expected that fifty school-boys could
restrain their merriment under such trying circumstances.
There was a wild burst of laughter, in
which, after an ineffectual attempt to resist the
infection, Mr. Tower himself was compelled to join.
Boys laughed till the tears came into their eyes, and
the merriment was only increased when James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Turner rose to his feet, and with an air of offended
majesty marched indignantly to his seat, darting a
look of withering scorn, as he meant it to be, at his
youthful audience.</p>

<p>The laughter recommenced, and became almost
hysteric. The principal, however, quickly recovered
himself, and said:—</p>

<p>“Boys, that will do. Turner, you must excuse the
boys for a little good-natured merriment at your
expense. I think your conception of the gestures
proper to use with your piece is not quite correct.
However, that is a point on which the most experienced
speakers are apt to make mistakes; not only
boys, but men. Your intention was good, though
the effect was injured by circumstances.”</p>

<p>These remarks ought to have appeased the offended
orator, but he evidently did not mean to be appeased
so readily. His feeling of mortification was swallowed
up in a greater feeling of anger and irritation
at the presumption of his school-mates, in daring to
laugh at him, the son of the richest man in Vernon.
He felt that he was entitled, rather, to be treated with
respect and deference. So he sat sullenly through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the remainder of the speaking, with an ill-tempered
scowl upon his features.</p>

<p>When the speaking was over, Mr. Tower rose and
said:—</p>

<p>“Boys, you are aware that at the commencement
of the term I offered a prize to the boy who, in your
own judgment, should be pronounced to have succeeded
best in declamation, taking into consideration
the whole term. As this is the last time we shall
declaim before vacation, I will call for the vote now.
I shall distribute small slips of paper among you, and
I will ask each boy to inscribe upon his slip the name
of that one who, in his opinion, deserves the prize.
We will afterwards count the votes.”</p>

<p>Slips of paper were accordingly distributed, and
the boys were soon busy in recording their votes.</p>

<p>“Sheffield, you may collect the votes,” said Mr.
Tower.</p>

<p>The boy referred to passed among the desks with
his hat, and the slips of paper were deposited therein.
These were handed to the teacher, who forthwith
proceeded to count them.</p>

<p>The count over, he rapped on his desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Boys,” he said, “I will announce the vote.
Votes cast, fifty. Of those Walter Sheffield has one;
James Turner, two; and the remainder, forty-seven
in number, are for Harry Raymond, to whom I have
great pleasure in awarding the prize, of which he has
been pronounced worthy by the nearly unanimous
vote of his school-mates. Raymond, you will come
forward.”</p>

<p>Harry Raymond advanced towards the teacher’s
desk, amid the loud applause of his companions.</p>

<p>Mr. Tower placed in his hands a handsomely bound
volume, consisting of selections from the best efforts
of orators, ancient and modern, saying:—</p>

<p>“I have great pleasure in giving you this volume,
Raymond, for my own judgment approves the selection
of your school-fellows. I trust you will be able to
express in your life, as you have so appropriately
done upon the platform, the lofty and elevated sentiments
of our best orators.”</p>

<p>There was a flush of gratification upon our hero’s
cheek, as he received the book with a respectful bow,
and returned to his seat amid the renewed applause
of his fellow-pupils.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">SOUR GRAPES.</span></h2>

<p>Harry Raymond lived in a small house, just off
the main street, fronting on a narrow road or lane.
The building lot, consisting of an acre of land, his
father had bought three years before for one hundred
and fifty dollars. After purchasing and paying for
it cash down, he found that he had but one hundred
dollars left towards the house which he wanted to
build. Under these circumstances he went to Squire
Turner, who was the moneyed man of the village,
and asked for a loan. Knowing that his money
would be safe, the squire agreed to furnish him what
money he might need towards the house, taking a
mortgage upon it when it was completed.</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond, therefore, at once commenced
building. His house cost a thousand dollars, of
which Squire Turner furnished him seven hundred,
the balance being made up of his own labor and cash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
in hand. So, when all was done, he regarded himself
as worth a property of twelve hundred dollars, subject
to a mortgage of seven hundred. During the
three years that had since elapsed he had managed,
besides paying interest, to pay up three hundred dollars
of the mortgage, leaving only four hundred due.
This had not been accomplished without some
economy; but his wife and Harry had cheerfully acquiesced
in this, being anxious for the time to come
when they might be clear owners of the little house.</p>

<p>The house contained six rooms, and stood about
fifty feet back from the street. The land in the rear
made an excellent garden, supplying them with all
the vegetables of which they had need.</p>

<p>Besides Harry, there was his sister Katy, a little
girl of ten, sweet and winning in her ways, to whom
he was warmly attached.</p>

<p>Mr. Raymond had kept Harry steadily at school,
feeling that a good education would be of far more
value to him in after life than the small amount he
might earn if kept at work. Harry had justified this
determination, having acquitted himself on all occasions
most creditably in all the studies which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
pursued. Out of school he found time to work in the
garden, and assist in various ways, by sawing and
splitting what wood was required for family use, so
that his father, on returning from his day’s labor was
not under the necessity of fatiguing himself by extra
work.</p>

<p>We will now return to the Vernon High School.</p>

<p>When school was dismissed, Harry Raymond was
surrounded by his friends, eager to congratulate him
on his success.</p>

<p>“I congratulate you, Harry,” said Walter Sheffield,
good-naturedly, “which is doing the handsome thing,
considering that I was your rival. You only had
forty-six more votes than I. That’s what I call a
close shave.”</p>

<p>“You voted for yourself, didn’t you, Sheffield?”
said Will Pomeroy.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to expose myself, if I did,” said
Walter.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder if Turner voted for himself,”
said one of the boys, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“But he had two votes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom Barton cast the other vote, of course,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
said Will Pomeroy, rather contemptuously. “He
fawns upon Turner just because he’s rich. I wish
him joy of his friend.”</p>

<p>“Say, Turner, did you vote for yourself?” called
out one of the boys.</p>

<p>“None of your business!” said James Turner,
sharply.</p>

<p>He stood a little on one side with his crony, Tom
Barton, surveying the scene with an ill-tempered
scowl. It was very disagreeable to him to see Harry
Raymond’s triumph. In fact, he hated our hero, for
no good reason except that Harry was his acknowledged
superior in acquirements, always standing
higher in his classes, and received from his school-mates
a degree of respect and deference which
James Turner with all his money could not buy.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you come and congratulate Raymond
on his prize?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather congratulate him on his pantaloons,”
said James, with a sneer.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with them?” demanded Will
Pomeroy, supposing at first that Harry might have
soiled them in some way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Patches seem to be in fashion,” said James, with
another sneer.</p>

<p>Of course the attention of all the boys was attracted
to Harry’s knee, and the patch, which had hitherto
escaped observation, was discovered.</p>

<p>Harry Raymond’s cheek flushed, for he saw that
an insult was intended, but he did not at once
speak.</p>

<p>“For shame, Turner!” said Will Pomeroy, indignantly,
and it was evident that the other boys sympathized
with him in his feeling.</p>

<p>“What should I be ashamed of?” retorted Turner.</p>

<p>“For your meanness in twitting Harry with the
patch.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t; I only mentioned it.”</p>

<p>“You are envious because he got the prize.”</p>

<p>“What do I care for the trumpery prize? It
didn’t cost more than a dollar and a half. My father
will buy me a dozen such books, if I want them.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he will; but for all that you’d have
taken it quick enough if you could have got it. It
isn’t the value of the book, it’s what it means.”</p>

<p>“What does it mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“That Harry Raymond is the best speaker in the
Vernon High School.”</p>

<p>“Boys,” said Harry, quietly, “don’t trouble yourselves
to defend me. I don’t care what James Turner
says. Perhaps the book didn’t cost more than a
dollar and a half, but it was given me by your votes,
and that makes it worth more to me than if it cost
a hundred dollars. I haven’t had a chance to say it
before, but I am grateful to you for your kindness in
awarding it to me, and I shall always treasure it for
that reason.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Harry Raymond!” called out
Walter Sheffield, waving his arm, and giving the
signal.</p>

<p>The three cheers were given with a will, and Harry
looked gratified at this proof of the regard in which
he was held.</p>

<p>“Now three groans for James Turner!” said
another.</p>

<p>“No, boys,” said Harry, promptly; “don’t do
that.”</p>

<p>“But he insulted you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean about the patch. But never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
mind about that. You all know that my father is a
poor man, and can’t afford to buy me expensive
clothes. If I get my clothes torn, I can’t afford to
throw them aside. I don’t like patches any better
than anybody, but till I get richer I shall wear
them.”</p>

<p>Harry spoke so manfully, that the boys heartily
sympathized with him. It might have been supposed
that James Turner would have been convinced of his
meanness, and ashamed of it; but he was essentially
a mean boy, and it may be added that a part of his
meanness came to him from his father, who, though a
rich man, was sordid and covetous, and never known
to do a generous action. So James now could not
refrain from a parting sneer.</p>

<p>“If Raymond wears patches because he is poor,”
he said, “I’ll give him a pair of pants that I’ve got
through wearing, any time when he’ll come up to the
house.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t trouble yourself,” said Harry, angry
at the insult. “When I want your cast-off clothes
I’ll let you know. I’ll go in rags first.”</p>

<p>“Just as you choose,” said James, sneering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
“There’s no accounting for tastes. Come along,
Barton.”</p>

<p>The two boys walked away, not much regretted by
those they left behind. If they had heard the remarks
made about them after their departure, neither
would have felt particularly complimented.</p>

<p>“The beggarly upstart!” said James to his companion.
“He puts on airs enough for a pauper.”</p>

<p>“So he does,” said Barton. “He can’t speak half
as well as you. But Mr. Tower’s prejudiced.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for his miserable prizes,” said James.
“They’re not worth thinking of.”</p>

<p>It was only another illustration of the well-known
fable of the fox and the grapes.</p>

<span class="smaller">A SUDDEN BLOW.</span></h2>

<p>Harry Raymond, after receiving the congratulations
of his school-mates, took his way homeward.
He was not obliged to travel by the road, as there
was a short cut across the field.</p>

<p>At the end of ten minutes he threw open the door,
and went into the house. His mother was ironing,
and Katy sat near by, reading a book.</p>

<p>“See what I’ve got, mother,” said Harry, holding
up his prize.</p>

<p>“What is it, Harry?”</p>

<p>“It’s the prize for declamation. The boys took a
vote, and it was awarded to me by forty-seven votes
out of fifty.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad to hear it,” said Mrs. Raymond,
and her face wore a proud look, as she glanced at the
bright and animated face of her son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who were the three boys that didn’t vote for
you?” asked Katy.</p>

<p>“I was one of them,” said Harry, smiling.</p>

<p>“Who did you vote for?”</p>

<p>“For Walter Sheffield.”</p>

<p>“Is he a good speaker?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But he isn’t as good as you are.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t for me to say.”</p>

<p>“Who got the other two votes?”</p>

<p>“James Turner.”</p>

<p>“He’s an awful disagreeable boy,” said Katy.
“He puts on all sorts of airs just because his father
is rich. I wish father was as rich as Squire Turner.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’d like to have him for a father.”</p>

<p>“No, I shouldn’t,” said Katy, quickly. “He’s
just as bad for a man, as James is for a boy.”</p>

<p>“So, you see, money isn’t everything,” said her
mother.</p>

<p>There was a deeper meaning in these words than
her children knew. There was one passage in her
early life, known only to herself and her husband,
with which the rich Squire Turner was connected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>As a girl, Mrs. Raymond had been very handsome,
and even now, at the age of thirty-six, she retained
much of her good looks. It was not generally
known that Squire Turner had been an aspirant for
her hand. But though he was even then rich, and
could have given her an attractive home—so far as
money can make a home attractive—she quietly rejected
his suit, and accepted Mr. Raymond, a journeyman
carpenter, with less than a hundred dollars.</p>

<p>This rejection Squire Turner never forgot nor forgave.
He was not a forgiving man, and his resentment
was bitter, though he did not choose to show it
publicly. Indeed, he treated Mr. and Mrs. Raymond,
to all appearance, as though nothing had happened;
but none the less he nursed his anger, and
waited patiently for an opportunity to repay, by
some grievous injury, the wrong which he fancied he
had suffered. About the same time with Mr. Raymond,
Squire Turner also married a Miss Ellis, a
sharp-tempered spinster from a neighboring town,
whose only redeeming point was the possession of
ten thousand dollars in her own right. Her husband
cared nothing for her, but only for her money, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the marriage was far from being a happy one.
Domestic dissension, and almost continual wrangling,
were what James had witnessed from his babyhood
up to the time of his mother’s death, a year
previous; and perhaps it is not surprising that the
son of such parents should have been unpopular, and
possessed of disagreeable traits.</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Raymond had applied to Squire Turner
for money to assist him in building his house. The
squire had two objects in granting this request.
First, the security was ample, and the investment a
good one; and, secondly, a debtor is always to some
extent in the power of his creditor. Squire Turner
was by no means averse to establishing this power
over the husband of the woman who had rejected his
suit. The time might come when he could make a
use of it.</p>

<p>“What piece did you speak to-day, Harry?”
asked his mother.</p>

<p>“The supposed speech of John Adams. You
remember how it begins: ‘Sink or swim, live or die,
survive or perish, I give my hand and my heart to
this vote.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I remember it.”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking, mother,” continued Harry
“that I shall take my motto from it.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean this: Sink or swim, I am going to do
my duty, and try to succeed in life. I am not going
to be frightened by obstacles, but am going to push
on as well as I can.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good motto, Harry. I hope you’ll have
strength to adhere to it.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go out and split a little wood, now,
mother.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would. I always burn a good deal on
ironing days.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll split up enough to last two or three
days. I have more time Wednesdays than Mondays.”</p>

<p>On Wednesday the only afternoon exercise was
declamation, so that, instead of closing at four, the
school was usually out, as to-day, at half-past two.
At half-past five Harry re-entered the house.</p>

<p>“Isn’t supper ready, mother?” he asked. “I’m
as hungry as a bear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Harry, it is ready; but your father has not
got home yet. I have been waiting for him.”</p>

<p>“Where is he at work?”</p>

<p>“On Doctor Lamson’s house, just across the railroad.
The doctor is in a hurry to get it finished as
soon as possible, and perhaps the carpenters are
working extra hours.”</p>

<p>“Did father say anything about it before he went
away this morning?”</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t mention any intention of stopping.
But he stopped on Monday a little over time, and
perhaps he has done so to-night.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope he’ll return soon, for I feel uncommonly
hungry.”</p>

<p>“If your father isn’t here by six, we’ll sit down.
I can keep the tea hot for him.”</p>

<p>Not a shadow of apprehension was in Mrs. Raymond’s
mind as she spoke, but already a heavy
calamity had fallen upon her, of which she was
unconscious.</p>

<p>Six o’clock came, and Mr. Raymond had not returned.</p>

<p>“I think you had better sit down to tea, children,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
said their mother. “I am not very hungry, and I
will wait for your father.”</p>

<p>They sat down accordingly, and Harry made a
hearty supper, quite justifying the report he had
given of his appetite.</p>

<p>Another hour passed away.</p>

<p>It was now seven o’clock, and Mr. Raymond was
still absent.</p>

<p>“I wonder your father does not come,” said Mrs.
Raymond, with a little vague restlessness, which had
not yet been converted into anxiety. “He has not
often been so late as this, without telling me beforehand
that he meant to stay away.”</p>

<p>“I think I will go out and meet him,” said Harry.</p>

<p>To this Mrs. Raymond made no objection, feeling,
on the whole, rather relieved by the proposal of her
son.</p>

<p>She set the tea once more on the stove, and the
bread and pie were also placed on the hearth of the
stove to keep warm.</p>

<p>“Your father must be hungry,” she said to Katy,
“as it is so late.”</p>

<p>Harry went out of the gate, and walked slowly up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the road in the direction of his father’s probable
return. He strained his eyes to see through the
gathering twilight, but could see nothing of his
father. Rather surprised at this, he kept on, until
he happened to meet in the street Hiram Payson,
who he knew had also been employed on Doctor
Lamson’s house.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Mr. Payson,” he said.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Harry; where are you going?
To the store?”</p>

<p>“No; I thought I would come out and see if I
could meet my father.”</p>

<p>“Meet your father? Why, where has he gone?”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t got home from work yet. Did you
start before him?”</p>

<p>“No; he started before me.”</p>

<p>“He did!” exclaimed Harry, in surprise. “What
time was that?”</p>

<p>“About five o’clock. I know it was not later than
that.”</p>

<p>“Where can he be?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you seen anything of him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“No. Did he say anything about going anywhere
before he returned home?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Where can he be?” asked Harry, again; and
this time there was anxiety in his tone.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, Harry,” said Hiram Payson,
“if you are going to look for him, I’ll join you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Payson. I wish you would.”</p>

<p>The two pushed on in the direction of Doctor
Lamson’s new house. It was probably about a mile
distant in all, the railroad being three-quarters of the
way. They reached the railroad, and, as if by
mutual consent, paused and looked about them.</p>

<p>“Your father sometimes walks on the railroad a
little distance, as far as Carter’s pasture. Perhaps
we had better take that way.”</p>

<p>Harry assented. There was a scared look on his
face, and a fear which he did not dare to define to
himself.</p>

<p>It was realized all too soon. About fifty rods distant,
they came upon the mangled remains of his
father, lying stretched across the track. His hearing
had been affected by a fever, which, he had three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
years previous. It was evident, that as he was walking
on the track, the train sweeping round a curve
had come upon him unawares, and his life was the
forfeit. Harry uttered one shriek of horror, and
sank down beside his father’s body, now cold in
death.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">AFTER THE FUNERAL.</span></h2>

<p>The grief of Mrs. Raymond and her two children,
for the death of the husband and father, was
very sharp and poignant. Had he died at home of
some lingering illness, their minds would have been
prepared in some measure for the stroke. But, cut
off as he was in an instant, the blow fell upon them
very heavily.</p>

<p>On the third day after the body was found, the
funeral took place. Harry attended as chief mourner,
for his mother was compelled to remain at home on account
of illness. But when the funeral was over other
cares forced themselves upon their attention. It is
only the rich who can afford to give themselves up
unreservedly to the luxury of grief. The poor must
rouse themselves to battle for their bread. In Mr.
Raymond’s death his family had not only lost an
affectionate husband and father, but the one upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
whom they had leaned for support. How they were
to live in future was a question which demanded
their earliest consideration.</p>

<p>They were gathered in the little sitting-room one
evening about a week after Mr. Raymond’s death.
Mrs. Raymond was looking sad and pale, while
Harry’s face was sober and earnest. He already
began to realize that his father’s cares and responsibilities
had fallen on his young shoulders, and that
it was his duty to take that father’s place as well as
he should be able.</p>

<p>“It is time, mother,” he said, “that we began to
talk about our future plans.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I don’t know what we shall do,” said
his mother, sighing, for to her the future looked
formidable.</p>

<p>But Harry was young, healthy, and sanguine, and
his spirits were lighter.</p>

<p>“Whatever we do, mother,” he said, “we won’t
despond. There are a great many ways of getting
a living, and I know that we shall get along somehow.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Mrs. Raymond, dubiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you remember that piece I spoke the other
day?”</p>

<p>“The one you got the prize for, Harry?” said his
sister.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t for that only, but for speaking the
whole term. The piece began with ‘Sink or Swim;’
and I told you then that I meant to take that for
my motto.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Harry?”</p>

<p>“I mean this, mother,” said Harry, with energy,
“that, sink or swim, I am going to do my best; and
if I do that, I think it’ll be swim and not sink.”</p>

<p>“But you are so young, Harry,” said his mother,
not very hopefully.</p>

<p>“I am fifteen,” said Harry, drawing himself up.
“I am well and strong, and I can work.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you can find to do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there are plenty of things,” said Harry, cheerfully,
though rather vaguely. It would, perhaps;
have puzzled him to enumerate the plenty of things;
but he was hopeful and confident, and that was in his
favor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you think you could build houses, Harry?”
asked Katy.</p>

<p>“None that would be worth living in,” he said,
smiling. “I don’t mean to be a carpenter. It
would take too long to learn, and the pay is never
very large. But the first thing to do, mother, is to
see how we stand.”</p>

<p>“There’s this house. That is all we have, and
Squire Turner holds a mortgage on that.”</p>

<p>“The mortgage is seven hundred dollars. How
much has been paid on it?”</p>

<p>“Three hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“Then we own it all except four hundred dollars.
It is worth fully twelve hundred dollars, so that we
are worth at least eight hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“That won’t last very long,” said Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>“Not if we spend it; but I hope we shan’t have to
do that. Still it gives us something to fall back
upon, in case I don’t succeed very well at first.
Then there is the furniture; that must be worth at
least two hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“It cost considerably more.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, we will call it two hundred dollars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
You see,” he added, cheerfully, “we have got up to
a thousand already. Now, mother, have you got any
money in the house?”</p>

<p>“About twenty-five dollars.”</p>

<p>“That is not much, but it is something. I suppose
that is all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t so bad as it might be. Think of
those who are left wholly destitute, with starvation
staring them in the face. When you think of that,
we are quite rich in comparison.”</p>

<p>“I might have had something to help along,” said
Mrs. Raymond, “but my father lost what little property
we had before he died, and left nothing at all.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t he a soldier in the war of 1812?”
inquired Harry.</p>

<p>“Yes, he served for over a year.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he get any pension, or anything else from
government?”</p>

<p>“No, he got no pension. He got a grant of land—eighty
acres, I believe—somewhere out in Wisconsin.”</p>

<p>“What did he do with the land?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“He never did anything. Land was only a dollar
and a quarter an acre, and nobody would give him
that. An agent offered him twenty-five dollars for
his grant, but he would not take it. Then he put
away the paper, and never did anything more about
it.”</p>

<p>“Have you got the paper now, mother?” asked
Harry, interested.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe so. I think I have it somewhere
in my bureau.”</p>

<p>“If it wouldn’t be too much trouble I would like
to see it. Can’t I find it?”</p>

<p>“No, I will go for it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond went upstairs, and shortly returned
with a paper yellow with age, setting forth that
Henry Mann, in consideration of services rendered
to the government, was entitled to a quarter section
of land, the location of which was specified.</p>

<p>“A quarter section!” said Harry. “That’s a
hundred and sixty acres,—more than you thought.”</p>

<p>“Is it?” said Mrs. Raymond, listlessly. “I
suppose it doesn’t make much difference now which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
it is. After so long a time there is no chance of getting
it, and I suppose it wouldn’t be worth much.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Harry. “At any
rate it’s worth looking into. Shall I keep the
paper?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you wish.”</p>

<p>“I will go round to-morrow, and see Squire
Turner, and perhaps he can give me some information
about it. But we haven’t talked about our plans
yet.”</p>

<p>“I have thought of nothing.”</p>

<p>“But I have. I will tell you about it, and see
what you think. First, I thought of hiring some
land, and turning farmer; but that’s hard work, and
requires more knowledge than I have got. Besides,
I don’t believe I could earn much.”</p>

<p>“No; I don’t think you could earn much that
way.”</p>

<p>“Then I thought I might go to the city, and get a
small stock of goods, and go round peddling. Or,
perhaps, I might get the agency for some popular
article, and travel about with it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am afraid it would be a great undertaking.
Besides, you have no money to invest.”</p>

<p>“That’s true; but I could raise some. Squire
Turner might advance me one hundred dollars, and
increase the mortgage to that amount. A hundred
dollars, or even less, would buy all the goods I
should want at one time. That would be my capital
in trade. As soon as I made money enough, I would
pay it back, and then we should be as well off as we
are now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think,” said Mrs. Raymond,
sighing. “I never had any head for business. I
always left those things to your father.”</p>

<p>“But you will consent to my asking such a loan?”</p>

<p>“Yes; if you really think it will do any good.”</p>

<p>“I do. Remember my motto, mother, ‘Sink or
swim!’ I’ve made up my mind to swim.”</p>

<p>Thus ended the conference. Harry saw that it
was as his mother said,—she had no head for business.
He must form his own plans, and carry them
through without assistance.</p>

<span class="smaller">SQUIRE TURNER.</span></h2>

<p>Before doing anything else, Harry determined to
consult some one about the land warrant. It might
be worth nothing, or very little; but in their present
circumstances they could not afford to give up even a
little.</p>

<p>As he had suggested in his conversation with his
mother, he decided to call on Squire Turner and ask
his advice. He did not particularly like the squire,
who was not popular in the neighborhood; but still
he had the reputation of being well acquainted with
matters of business, and, though not a regular lawyer,
was accustomed to draw up deeds, and conveyances,
and wills, and, in fact, supplied the place of a lawyer
so far as his neighbors were concerned. There was
no one in the village so likely as the squire to advise
him correctly about the land warrant. So Harry put
on his cap the next morning, and, with the document<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
in his breast-pocket, set out on his way to Squire
Turner’s residence.</p>

<p>It was a large, square dwelling-house, setting back
some distance from the road. There were two gates,
at the right and left hand, and a semicircular driveway,
extending from one to the other, passed the
front door.</p>

<p>It was half-past eight o’clock, and James Turner
was standing on the front steps with his books under
his arm. He had just come out, and was about to
start for school. James surveyed Harry’s approach
with some curiosity.</p>

<p>“Halloo!” said he; “what do you want?”</p>

<p>This was not a very civil or cordial greeting, and
Harry did not feel compelled to satisfy his curiosity.</p>

<p>“My business is not with you,” he said; “it is
with your father.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve come for a job,” said James,
coarsely. “I suppose you’ll be awful poor.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Harry, coolly.
“I guess I shall be able to make a living.”</p>

<p>“Maybe my father’ll hire you to saw wood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you; but that isn’t the business I am
thinking of following.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are going to be a merchant,”
sneered James.</p>

<p>“Very likely I may be some time.”</p>

<p>Harry was not much troubled by the rudeness of
James; for he cared nothing for him or his good
opinion. James was a little nettled to find that his
taunts rebounded so harmlessly, and this led him to
one parting shot.</p>

<p>Harry had ascended the front steps, and was about
to ring the bell, when James said, “You needn’t
ring. You can go round to the back door.”</p>

<p>“Is that where you go in?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then, if you use the front door, I shall,” and
Harry rang a peal a little louder than he would
have otherwise done.</p>

<p>James muttered something about his not knowing
his place; but before the door was opened marched
off for school.</p>

<p>The door was speedily opened by a servant.</p>

<p>“Is Squire Turner in?” asked Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, he is. Won’t you come in?”</p>

<p>Harry entered, and passed into a room on the
right, which the squire generally used as a sitting
room. It was provided with a desk, studded with
pigeon-holes, most of which were filled with papers.
Here it was that the amateur lawyer received business
calls, and transacted such business as came to
his hands.</p>

<p>He looked round as Harry entered.</p>

<p>Squire Turner, whom I may as well describe here,
was a tall man, with iron-gray hair, and a slight
stoop in the shoulders. His face, which was rather
harsh, began to show wrinkles. It was not, on the
whole, a very pleasing or encouraging aspect; but
Harry Raymond, who was used to the squire’s looks,
did not waste much thought upon this. It was his
nature to go directly to the point.</p>

<p>“Did you want to see me?” asked the squire, adjusting
his spectacles, and looking at our hero.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“I’m rather busy now. Be as quick as you can.”</p>

<p>“My father’s death,” said Harry, his lip quivering
a little as he said it, “makes it necessary for me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
form some plans about getting along. I was reckoning
up yesterday how much we had to start with,
when my mother showed me a paper which may be
worth something. Probably you will know. So I
have brought it along to show you.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Squire Turner.</p>

<p>Harry drew it out from his pocket, and handed it
to the squire.</p>

<p>“I see it’s a land warrant in favor of your grandfather,”
he said, after a little examination.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Given in return for his services in the war of
1812.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Is it worth anything?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he ever take up the land?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir; except that Wisconsin was a
good ways off, and I believe he had some property at
that time, so that he did not need it. Mother says he
was offered twenty-five dollars by an agent, but
wouldn’t accept it. After that, he appears to have
put it away in his drawer, and forgotten it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Humph!” said the squire, reflectively, running
his eyes over the document.</p>

<p>“Do you think I can get anything for it?” asked
Harry.</p>

<p>“I am not prepared to say, positively,” said the
squire, slowly. “My impression is, that, after this
length of time, it would be impossible to get anything
for it.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid that might be the case,” said Harry.
“Is there any way of finding out about it?”</p>

<p>“If you’ll leave it with me, I will take steps to
ascertain,” said Squire Turner.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. If we get anything for it, we
shall, of course, be willing to pay you for your
trouble.”</p>

<p>Most men would at once have assured Harry that no
payment would be necessary; but Squire Turner was
never known to refuse a fee,—he was too fond of
money for that,—nor was it his intention to do so
now. He accordingly answered, “Well, I will see
about it. It may take some time.”</p>

<p>“There was something else I wished to speak to
you about,” said Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Proceed.”</p>

<p>“You hold a mortgage upon our place.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“It is now reduced to four hundred dollars by payments
made by my father.”</p>

<p>“Do you wish to pay the remainder?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I am not able to. What I want is, to
get another hundred dollars from you on the same
security, making it five hundred dollars instead of
four.”</p>

<p>“What do you want with the money?”</p>

<p>“I have been thinking that I might get a stock of
goods in the city, and go about selling them. I have
got to do something, and I think I might make
money that way.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t let you have the money,” said the
squire.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I suppose not. But mother is willing, as
she will tell you herself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but I can do it,” said the squire,
after a little pause. “Mind, I don’t give any advice
as to the plan you have in view. You may make it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
pay, and you may not. Perhaps it would be better
to get something to do about here.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t much chance in Vernon,” answered
Harry; “and there are plenty to do what little work
there is.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s your affair. About the money, I
will consider the matter, and if you will come round
to-morrow, I will let you know what I have decided.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“And about the land warrant, I will write out to a
lawyer I know in Milwaukie, and ask his opinion.
When his answer comes, I will let you know.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Harry; and, his business
being at an end, he took his cap, and with a bow left
the room.</p>

<p>On the whole, he was better pleased with the
result of the interview than he anticipated. Squire
Turner had not been very cordial or sympathetic, it
is true, but he seemed disposed to grant the request
which he had made; and, though Harry did not like
him, he had a very good opinion of his business
abilities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“If we can only get a hundred dollars or so for
the land warrant,” he said to himself, “it will be a
great help.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">HARRY OBTAINS A PLACE.</span></h2>

<p>On the way back from Squire Turner’s, Harry
stepped into the village store, as he had one or two
small articles to purchase for his mother. This store
was kept by Jonas Porter, a man over fifty, in rather
poor health. On this account he was obliged to depend
considerably upon two young men, whom he
employed as assistants. One of them, John Gaylord,
was twenty-five years of age, and an efficient
salesman. The other, Alfred Harper, was about
eighteen, and of course less experienced and valuable.
The last was employed partly in driving the
store wagon with goods to different parts of the
village.</p>

<p>Harry entered the store, and, going up to the
counter, said to the proprietor, who was standing
behind, “Mr. Porter, I want two pounds of brown
sugar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“How is your mother?” asked the store-keeper.</p>

<p>“Not very well,” answered Harry.</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not. Your father’s death must be
a great blow to her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. It is to all of us.”</p>

<p>“I hope she will soon be feeling better. Health is
a blessing we don’t appreciate till we lose it. I have
not been feeling very well, lately. In fact, I am not
fit to be in the store.”</p>

<p>“Where is Alfred Harper? I have not seen him
for a day or two.”</p>

<p>“He has been taken sick, and has gone home.
He may be sick some weeks. It is unlucky just now,
for I am not fit to be in the store. I wish I could
get somebody to take his place for a few weeks.”</p>

<p>Here an idea struck Harry. He was not as old as
Alfred Harper, but he was strong, and he thought he
might be able to do his work. He decided to suggest
it to the store-keeper.</p>

<p>“If you thought I would do,” he said, “I should
be glad to come into the store. I have got to go to
work now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am afraid you are too young,” said Mr. Porter,
doubtfully. “How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Fifteen, sir.”</p>

<p>“That is young.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but I am pretty stout and strong of my
age.”</p>

<p>“You look so. Can you drive a horse?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir. I have done that a good many
times.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the store-keeper, hesitating a
little. “You couldn’t do as much as Alfred; still,
you could help a good deal. I have always heard
good accounts of you. Mr. Gaylord, how will it do
to engage Harry Raymond a few weeks while Alfred
is away?”</p>

<p>“I think it would be a good plan, sir,” said John
Gaylord, who was familiar with Harry’s good reputation,
and had a very favorable opinion of him. “It
would lighten your labors a good deal.”</p>

<p>“Very true; and I am really not able to be in the
store. Well, Harry,” he proceeded, “I guess you
may come.”</p>

<p>“When shall I come?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“The sooner the better.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll come this afternoon,” said Harry
promptly. “I want to go home and split up a little
wood for mother, enough to last her.”</p>

<p>“Very well. About the pay, I will give you six
dollars a week.”</p>

<p>Six dollars a week! This seemed to Harry a large
sum. His father had only been paid two dollars
per day, and therefore received but twice as much.
He had hoped, to be sure, to earn more as a peddler
but then his expenses would be large, and, after all
he might fail, for it was but an experiment. Here
there was no risk, but a certain weekly income.
Besides,—and this was an important consideration,—it
would enable him to continue at home, and he
knew that just at this time his mother and little Katy
would feel his absence more than at any other time.</p>

<p>Good news always quickens the step. Harry
entered the house briskly, and placed the parcels he
had brought from the store upon the table.</p>

<p>“Here are the sugar and butter, mother,” he said.
“Now I’ll go out and split you some wood, for I’ve
got to go to work this afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“What kind of work?” asked Mrs. Raymond,
looking up.</p>

<p>“Alfred Harper is sick, and so is Mr. Porter. So
he has engaged me to take Alfred’s place for the
present, at a salary of six dollars a week. I think
that’s pretty lucky.”</p>

<p>“Then you won’t have to leave home,” said his
mother, brightening up for the first time. “I was so
afraid you would have to, and that would make it
very lonely for Katy and me.”</p>

<p>“No, I shall be at home, only you won’t see much
of me, for I’ve got to go to the store early, and I
suppose I shall get home late.”</p>

<p>“At any rate, you won’t be away from Vernon.
I don’t think I could bear to part from you just
now.”</p>

<p>“Did you call and see Squire Turner, Harry?”
asked Katy.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I almost forgot to tell you. He has
taken the paper, and is going to write to a lawyer in
Milwaukie about it.”</p>

<p>“Does he think it is worth anything?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t give much hope, it’s so many years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
ago; so we won’t count upon it. I asked him about
letting me have a hundred dollars to start in business
with, and he said he would let me know to-morrow.
I didn’t know then that I could get a place with Mr.
Porter.”</p>

<p>“I would rather have you with Mr. Porter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I would rather stay there for the present.
But you must remember that it won’t last but a few
weeks. After that I may have to do as I proposed.”</p>

<p>Harry went out, and labored manfully at the wood-pile
for a couple of hours. Then he got the basket
and carried in considerable and piled it up in the
kitchen, so that his mother might not have the
trouble of going out to get it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Squire Turner was writing a letter to a
Mr. Robinson, a Milwaukie lawyer, whom he knew.
He stated the matter fully, giving his correspondent,
however, the idea that the warrant had come into his
own possession. In fact, he had made up his mind,
in case the paper should be worth anything, to turn
it to his own benefit, by hook or by crook. He was
a rich man already, to be sure; but he was not contented
with what he had, nor was he likely to be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
He was, as I have already stated, a grasping, avaricious
man, and as long as money went into his
pocket he cared very little that it was at the expense
of the widow and orphan. He did not build any very
high hopes on the warrant. Still he was not a man
to let a chance slip by.</p>

<p>In the course of a fortnight he received an answer
to his letter. As it is of some importance, I will
transcribe it here:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Milwaukie, Wis.</span>, May 27, 18—.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Turner</span>,—Dear sir: yours of the 21st, asking
information as to the probable value of a certain
land warrant in your possession, has come to hand.
It appears that the land was located, though the
owner never appeared to take possession of it. In
consequence it has fallen into the hands of others.
The tract in question is a valuable one, being situated
only a few miles out of Milwaukie, and has upon it
several valuable buildings. My own opinion is, that
if the matter is followed up, though you might not be
able to get possession without a protracted lawsuit,
so much value being involved, the present holders
would be willing to pay a considerable sum by way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of compromise. It might be worth while for you to
come on, and see about the matter yourself. I will
assist you to the best of my ability.</p>

<p class="center">“Yours respectfully,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Francis Robinson</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Squire Turner read this letter with a lively interest.
So the neglected yellow paper promised to be
valuable, after all. Perhaps, indeed, it might be
worth thousands of dollars. In that case, Mrs. Raymond
would be very well off.</p>

<p>The main question in Squire Turner’s mind was,
how could he manage so as to profit by it himself.
He was meditating upon this as he walked home from
the post-office, when he met Harry Raymond, driving
the store-wagon.</p>

<p>Harry paused, and hailed the squire.</p>

<p>“Squire Turner,” he said, “have you found out
anything yet about that paper I left with you?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said the squire, falsely; for he had no
intention of disclosing the truth at present. “I am
afraid we can’t get anything for it after so many
years. When I hear anything I will let you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was afraid it was too long ago,” said Harry;
“so I am not much disappointed.”</p>

<p>“I am thinking of taking a little trip to the West
before long,” said Squire Turner. “I may be able
to find out something about it then.”</p>

<p>Harry started the horse towards the store, and
thought so little of the land warrant that he quite
forgot to mention the matter to his mother in the
evening.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">A MEAN TRICK.</span></h2>

<p>Harry Raymond had been employed in Mr.
Porter’s store but a few days when he had a
difficulty with James Turner, which deserves to be
chronicled. For various reasons James cherished a
dislike of our hero, which he was not likely to get
over very soon. Harry had always distanced him in
his studies, and, as we have seen, had carried off the
prize for declamation, which James persuaded himself
would have been his but for the partiality of Mr.
Tower. Again, James aspired to be a leader among
the boys at school and in the village. He felt that
this position was due to him on account of the superior
wealth of his father. When boys assert this
claim to consideration, it is generally a sign that
they have little else to boast of; and this was
precisely the case with James Turner.</p>

<p>Now, it may appear strange, that though Squire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Turner was the richest man in the village, and Mr.
Raymond one of the poorest, the boys paid much
more respect to Harry than to the son of the wealthy
squire. Harry was put forward prominently on all
occasions; as, for example, when a military company
was formed, he was elected captain, while James
could not even obtain the post of simple corporal.
Of course the latter withdrew his name from the roll
in disgust; but the company, so far from being
thrown into consternation, appeared to thrive about
as well as before. This military organization went
by the name of the Vernon Guards, and consisted
of about thirty boys. They used to parade on
Saturday afternoons, when a sufficient number could
be gathered for duty, and the young captain, who had
studied up his duties, discharged them in a very
creditable manner.</p>

<p>James Turner, however, had one consolation in all
this strange neglect. His superiority was conceded
by one boy, who was in the habit of revolving round
him like a humble satellite. This was Tom Barton,
who has already been referred to. Tom was a born
sycophant, and was ready on all occasions to natter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
James and join him in abusing Harry and Harry’s
friends. Tom’s father was in California at the
mines. His mother was a weak woman, of an
envious disposition, who was always bewailing her
fate in having married a poor man instead of a
certain other person who had turned out rich, and
who, as she asserted, had offered her his hand in
early life. In fact, it was generally supposed that
her complaints had driven her husband to California
to seek for the fortune for which she was continually
pining. As for Tom, she considered him one of the
smartest boys in America, and, as might be expected,
asserted that he took after her, and not after his
father.</p>

<p>“There aint any Barton about him,” she said.
“He’s all Jessup.”</p>

<p>This was not far from true. Tom certainly did
inherit his mother’s mean and disagreeable qualities,
and there were very few points in which he resembled
his father, who was really a worthy man, and
deserved a better wife than had been allotted to
him.</p>

<p>It might have been supposed that Harry’s misfortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
in losing his father would have led to a suspension
of ill feeling on the part of James and his
sycophant. But I have already said that James was
a mean boy, and Tom was in this respect a very
fitting companion for him. Indeed, Tom, besides
espousing James’s quarrel, had a personal grievance
of his own. At the time that Alfred Harper entered
the village store, Mr. Porter had an application for
the place from Tom, which he had seen fit to decline
without assigning any reasons for so doing. In
fact, Tom had the reputation of being lazy and self-sufficient,
and the store-keeper rightly concluded that
he would not be likely to prove a very valuable
assistant. When Tom heard that the coveted place
had been given to Harry, he felt highly indignant,
not only with Mr. Porter, but with Harry himself,
and was anxious for an opportunity of wreaking vengeance
upon our hero. Now, the manliest way would
have been to make a direct assault upon him; but
this he did not care to do. He knew that Harry
had a pair of good, strong arms, and was ready on
all occasions to defend himself. If he should venture
upon an attack, it was pretty clear to him that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
would get the worst of it, and this would be very far
from suiting him. He preferred to wait for some
secret way of injuring him.</p>

<p>That opportunity came about a week after Harry
had entered upon his duties in Mr. Porter’s store.</p>

<p>It has already been said that one of his duties was
to drive the store-wagon, and deliver groceries in
different parts of the village. One afternoon he was
driving at about half a mile distance from the store.
Among other articles in the wagon was a basket
containing three dozen eggs, which, by the way,
were to be delivered to Squire Turner’s house-keeper.</p>

<p>Just about this part of the road there was a cliff
on one side, about twenty feet in height, with a steep,
almost perpendicular, descent. The field terminating
thus abruptly belonged to Squire Turner. It so
happened that James Turner and Tom Barton were
walking leisurely along the cliff just as Harry came
driving by.</p>

<p>“There’s Harry Raymond,” said Tom, spitefully.
“Old Barton must have been hard up for a clerk
when he took him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose he took pity on him,” said James,
“and gave him the situation to keep him out of the
poor-house.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t the way he looks at it,” said Tom.
“He puts on as many airs as if he owned the store
himself.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you try for the place once, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Why, not exactly,” said Tom. “I told him I
would take it if he couldn’t get anybody else. It
isn’t much of a place.”</p>

<p>Of course this was only a salvo for Tom’s
wounded pride, for he had been eager to enter the
store.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what,” added Tom, after a pause,
“suppose we play a trick on Raymond.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a trick?”</p>

<p>“Suppose we pitch a stone into that basket of
eggs. There’ll be an awful smash, and he can’t see
who did it.”</p>

<p>This was a proposition which just suited James.
It would get Harry into trouble with his employer,
and this of course would be rare sport. Then, as
they could easily withdraw from sight, he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
never know to whom he was indebted for the favor.
All these considerations darted through James
Turner’s mind more quickly than I have stated
them, and he responded:—</p>

<p>“All right, Tom. You do it. You can fire
straighter than I.”</p>

<p>Tom needed no second approval. He seized a
stone about as large as his two fists, or perhaps a
little larger, and, bending over the cliff, fired it
directly at the basket.</p>

<p>His success was all that he could have wished.
His aim was a true one, and the first Harry knew of
the “trick,” there was a loud crash behind him, and
the contents of the eggs were partially spattered
over him. Glancing quickly back, he saw that the
wreck was almost total. Of the three dozen eggs
not one third had escaped destruction.</p>

<p>Now, though Harry was naturally good-natured, he
felt that this was a little too much for good-nature.
It might be a joke; but he could not see it in that
light. He knew that he was likely to be blamed for
the accident, and he resolved to find out how it came
about. It was not very probable that the stone came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
into the basket of its own volition. There was
evidently some human agency concerned, and this
agency Harry determined to ascertain.</p>

<p>Looking up, he just caught a glimpse of Tom
Barton peering over to see what mischief had been
done.</p>

<p>“It’s that mean Tom Barton,” he said to himself.
“He’s about the only fellow mean enough to play
such a trick. Perhaps he thinks I’m going to stand
it.”</p>

<p>“Whoa!” shouted Harry.</p>

<p>In obedience to the summons the horse came to a
halt.</p>

<p>Harry drew him to the side of the road, and
jumped out of the wagon. He hesitated about leaving
the horse unattended; but just at that moment
Will Pomeroy came along.</p>

<p>“Just mind the horse a minute, Will,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you when I come back.”</p>

<p>Our hero felt that there was no time for explanation.
He began to clamber up the side of the cliff.
This was a hard job, for it was nearly perpendicular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>,
but here and there were roots and bushes that helped
him along. Probably his indignation helped him, for
in a very short time he reached the top.</p>

<p>Tom Barton was elated at the success of his trick.
After first looking over to see the extent of the
damage, he withdrew to a short distance, and threw
himself under a tree by the side of James Turner.
He felt entirely safe, not having the least idea that
Harry would undertake to climb the cliff.</p>

<p>The two boys were laughing together over the
success of their trick, when the figure of our hero, his
face red with excitement, and his hands chafed and
torn, presented itself unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Tom sprang to his feet in dismay.</p>

<p>“Look here, Tom Barton,” said Harry, in a quick,
peremptory way, “what did you mean by pitching a
stone into my basket of eggs?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” said James Turner, in a low
voice; “I’ll stand by you.”</p>

<p>This emboldened Tom. Though he would not
have liked to engage in single combat with Harry, he
concluded that our hero would be in no haste to
engage both. So he answered, insolently:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“None of your business!”</p>

<p>“It strikes me that it is my business,” said Harry,
warmly. “It was a mean, contemptible trick.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do about it?” sneered
Tom.</p>

<p>Now I am not going to justify Harry for the course
he took, but it was certainly very natural.</p>

<p>“Stand up here, if you dare, and you’ll see,” he
answered, with compressed lips.</p>

<p>“Let’s give him a licking, James,” said Tom.
“It’ll do him good.”</p>

<p>Both boys sprang to their feet, and advanced
towards our hero. He saw that his task was not
going to be an easy one. The united strength of
both of his assailants was undoubtedly greater than
his own. If he allowed the two to come to close
quarters with him, he would probably get the worst
of it. Here was a chance for strategy, and he resolved
to improve it.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BATTLE OF THE CLIFF.</span></h2>

<p>Some of my readers are no doubt familiar with the
memorable combat between the Horatii and the
Curiatii, told in all the Roman histories. There were
three brothers on each side, and the contest between
them was to decide the fortunes of the armies to
which they respectively belonged. After a time two
of the Horatii lay dead upon the field. The third,
unhurt, found himself opposed to three adversaries,
all of whom, however, were wounded. These he
managed to engage singly, and was thus enabled to
overcome them in turn.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether Harry Raymond had heard
of this historical combat; but when he found himself
opposed to two enemies, it struck him at once that
this was his proper course, if he wanted to come off
victorious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>As Tom and James advanced upon him, he feigned
to retreat.</p>

<p>“He’s afraid!” said Tom, in exultation. “Let’s
give him a licking.”</p>

<p>James had no possible objection. Indeed, he felt
that there was nothing he would enjoy so much as to
see our hero humiliated. He would not have ventured
to attack him alone, but now with Tom’s assistance
there seemed an excellent opportunity, such as
might not again present itself.</p>

<p>“Go ahead!” he called out. “I’ll help you.”</p>

<p>Tom did go ahead. Being a faster runner than
James, he found himself separated from him by a
considerable distance in the impetuosity of his
pursuit.</p>

<p>Harry turned his head, and, seeing that his opportunity
had come, suddenly faced round upon his
astonished adversary.</p>

<p>Tom, unable to check himself, almost rushed into
the arms of our hero.</p>

<p>“Now defend yourself!” shouted Harry.</p>

<p>So saying, he clinched Tom, who was too astonished
to defend himself properly, and with a quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
movement of the leg brought him down heavily upon
the ground, with Harry on top.</p>

<p>Lying on the ground, in such a position as to fit
into the small of Tom’s back, was a stone about as
large as the one he had thrown into the basket of
eggs. The sensation which resulted from falling
upon it was by no means pleasant.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he whined, “I’ve broken my backbone.
Get off from me, Harry Raymond.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll get over it,” said Harry, who knew
that the hurt could not be very serious.</p>

<p>“Jim Turner!” shouted the fallen hero.</p>

<p>James, who had witnessed his friend’s discomfiture,
paused at a little distance. He began to doubt
whether it would be prudent to take an active part in
the hostilities. His confederate was disabled, and he
strongly suspected that Harry was more than a
match for him. Still he was rather ashamed to hold
aloof.</p>

<p>“Let him alone!” he called out, from the place
where he stood, making no motion to advance.</p>

<p>“Come and help me, Jim! You said you would,”
said Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll have you arrested,” said James, preparing to
war with his tongue.</p>

<p>“Take him off!” entreated Tom.</p>

<p>Thus adjured, James advanced with hesitating
steps to the rescue. He would rather have been
excused, and had there been any decent pretext for
giving up the undertaking he would have done so.
But, though his sentiment of honor was not very
keen, it did occur to him that it would be rather
mean to leave Tom in the lurch, after he had urged
him on to the assault with the promise of assistance.</p>

<p>“Let him alone!” he exclaimed, reinforcing his
failing courage with a little bluster, “or you’ll get
the worst licking you ever had.”</p>

<p>“Who’ll give it to me?” asked Harry, composedly.</p>

<p>He had merely retained his position, pinning Tom
to the ground, but not striking him; for he was too
honorable to strike a prostrate foe.</p>

<p>“I will,” said James, with a boldness of manner
which did not by any means correspond to his inward
feelings.</p>

<p>So saying, he made a step or two in advance, in a
threatening manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry sprang up suddenly, and advanced upon his
new foe.</p>

<p>“I’m ready for you, James Turner,” he said, “now
or at any other time. Come on, if you dare.”</p>

<p>James paused in his advance. He did not like the
position of affairs at all. He had never bargained to
meet Harry in single combat, and now it appeared
likely that he would have to do so.</p>

<p>“Get up, Tom,” he called out. “The two of us
can whip him soundly.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do anything,” whined Tom. “My back’s
most broke.”</p>

<p>He rose slowly from the ground, and began with a
rueful face to rub the injured portion of his frame.</p>

<p>Thus left to himself James saw that there was no
backing out. He had provoked the contest, and
must take the consequences. What these were likely
to be he was cheerfully reminded by Tom’s doleful
face. He resolved to secure his co-operation if
possible.</p>

<p>“Come along, Tom,” he urged. “Just help me a
little, and I’ll manage him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can’t,” said Tom, dismally. “That plaguy
rock’s worn a hole in my back.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stand you both,” said Harry, stoutly.
“You’ve served me a mean trick, and you ought to
be punished.”</p>

<p>Just then James noticed a stone about the size of
his fist lying on the ground before him. It was a
mean and cowardly impulse that led him to pick it
up, and fire it full at our hero’s head. Had it struck
him, the injury would have been serious, if not fatal;
but Harry quickly divined his intention, and dropped
suddenly to the ground. The stone passed harmlessly
over his head.</p>

<p>“You shall pay for that, James Turner,” he said,
angrily. “No one but a coward would do such a
thing.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he sprang forward, and grappled with
his adversary. James, having a premonition of
defeat, defended himself poorly, flinging out blows at
random. In less than a minute he, too, was prostrate,
with Harry on top.</p>

<p>“Help!” he screamed, making desperate efforts to
unseat his opponent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>But Harry held him down with a tight grip. Tom
had had enough fighting, and did not stir to his
assistance.</p>

<p>“Get up, you ragamuffin!” he screamed. In fact
he was more mortified that his defeat should have
come from Harry Raymond than if his opponent had
been of his own position. That a poor boy like
Harry should treat with such indignity his father’s
son was a gross outrage which filled him with vexation.</p>

<p>“Let me up, you beggar!” he cried, again.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to speak to me in a different style
before I let you up,” said Harry, coolly, for he felt
that the advantage was in his hands, and that it was
for him to dictate terms of submission.</p>

<p>“I called you by your right name,” said James,
provoked beyond the limits of prudence. “You are
a ragamuffin and a beggar.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me that you are a beggar just now,”
said our hero.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that you are begging me to let you
up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you don’t I’ll have you arrested,” said James,
with another violent but ineffectual struggle.</p>

<p>“You’re welcome to do it,” said Harry. “Perhaps
there’ll be something to say on my side as well as
yours.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t come and help me, Tom Barton, I’ll
never speak to you again,” said James, whose anger
was now directed against his confederate.</p>

<p>“I would if I could,” said Tom, “but my back’s
too sore.”</p>

<p>The fact was, that Tom’s back was not quite so
much hurt as he wished to have it believed, but he
had no inclination to attack Harry again. The ease
with which he had been thrown, caused him to
realize that Harry carried “too many guns for him,”
as the phrase is; and, though he was ready to fawn
upon James, he was not willing to compromise his
personal safety for him. But a bright idea occurred
to him.</p>

<p>“I’ll go and call your father,” he said.</p>

<p>James did not answer. He would rather have had
Tom’s personal aid, but that he was not likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
obtain. Tom Barton, glad to get away, limped off
towards the road.</p>

<p>“Are you going to let me up?” demanded James,
fiercely.</p>

<p>“That depends upon whether you behave yourself.
Promise to fire no more stones at me.”</p>

<p>“I won’t.”</p>

<p>“You won’t fire any stones?”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t promise.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Then you may lie here a little
longer.”</p>

<p>So the two remained in their old position. Five
minutes passed, and James renewed his demand.</p>

<p>“As soon as you will say that you won’t fire any
more stones you shall get up.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to,” said James, sullenly.</p>

<p>“All right! That’s all I want,” said Harry; and
he relaxed his hold upon his prostrate foe, and rose
to his feet.</p>

<p>James picked himself up, and glared at Harry with
a look by no means friendly.</p>

<p>“You shall pay for this,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who is going to pay for the eggs you broke?”
retorted our hero.</p>

<p>“I didn’t break them.”</p>

<p>“You approved it, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” said James.</p>

<p>“You probably didn’t know where I was carrying
them.”</p>

<p>“Where?” James condescended to ask.</p>

<p>“To your house. I’ve lost time enough already,
and must be getting back.”</p>

<p>Harry hurried to the road, where he found the
wagon safe under the charge of Will Pomeroy.
Jumping in, he drove in haste to Squire Turner’s
residence, and taking the basket of eggs carried them
round to the side door, which was opened by Mrs.
Murray, the house-keeper.</p>

<p>“Here are some eggs from the store,” said Harry,
holding out the basket.</p>

<p>“Why, they’re all broke,” said the house-keeper, in
dismay.</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Harry. “If you want to know
how it happened ask James.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I never!” ejaculated the house-keeper,
mechanically taking the basket. “The squire’ll have
to do without his omelet to-night, that’s sure.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">FIRE!</span></h2>

<p>James did not fail to make a report to his father of
the outrage which he had received at the hands of
Harry Raymond. Over the trick which Tom and he
had played upon our hero he passed rather lightly.</p>

<p>“It seems there were two of you,” said the squire.
“Why didn’t you give him such a lesson as he would
have remembered?”</p>

<p>“I would if Tom had stood by me.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he pretended to be very much hurt!” said
James.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you manage young Raymond alone?”</p>

<p>“No; he’s as strong as a bull. He’s had to work
for a living, and that has given him muscle.”</p>

<p>“Then you and Tom had better watch your chance,
and give him a sound thrashing. I am perfectly
willing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>This was not quite what James wanted. The
result of the first contest had not been such as to
encourage him much to renew it, even with Tom’s
assistance, and this might fail him at a critical
moment as on a former occasion.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you got a mortgage on his mother’s
place?” he asked, hesitating.</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” said the squire.</p>

<p>“Can’t you call for the money, and if she can’t pay
it turn her out of the house?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to do it at present,” said the squire.
“You must settle your quarrel in some other way.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to pay for the broken eggs?”</p>

<p>“As long as you broke them, I can’t very well
refuse.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t me. It was Tom.”</p>

<p>“There’s little difference.”</p>

<p>James was rather astonished at the moderate view
which his father took of the matter. He had been
fully convinced that the squire would sympathize
with him in the affair, and be ready to join in any
scheme to punish Harry Raymond for his insolence.
Under ordinary circumstances, this was precisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
what his father would have done. But there was a
secret cause for his present conduct, and this shall
at once be explained.</p>

<p>It has been said that Squire Turner had offered
himself in marriage to Mrs. Raymond in early life,
and that she had seen fit to decline his proposal.
Both she and the squire had married, but now, by
the dispensation of Providence, she was a widow and
he a widower. Though now thirty-six, Mrs. Raymond
was still a handsome woman, and, if surrounded
by the appliances of wealth, she would make a wife
of whom any man might be proud. Certainly she
presented a very favorable contrast to the late Mrs.
Turner, who had a sour, acid visage, and a temper
to match, as her husband had often experienced to
his cost. There is reason to believe that when that
amiable lady was removed by death her husband was
not disconsolate, but consoled himself with the fact
that she could not carry away the property which she
had brought him, and without which she would never
have become Mrs. Turner.</p>

<p>Now the squire had had some vague thoughts that
he might marry again, but no one in particular had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
occurred to him as worthy to fill the place of the late
Mrs. Turner. But when Mrs. Raymond was suddenly
left a widow, and the report of the lawyer in Milwaukie
rendered it likely that she might come into
possession of a considerable sum of money, it set the
squire to thinking.</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond was still a young woman, and he
had never got over the fancy he had felt for her in
earlier years. Indeed, she was the only one that had
ever touched the squire’s rather flinty heart. He had
not even liked the late Mrs. Turner, which was not
much to be wondered at, for it is doubtful whether
the warmest-hearted person could have felt much
affection for so disagreeable a woman. He was rather
pleased with the idea of offering his hand to his first
love, especially if she could bring him a handsome
addition to his present property. The chances of this
he thought very fair. The lawyer had written very
encouragingly, and he knew how rapidly real estate
advanced at the West.</p>

<p>There was one important question, Would Mrs.
Raymond smile upon his suit, or would she repulse
him as before? The squire thought with proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
management he might secure her consent. She had
outlived the period of romance; there was no rival
in the way, and for the sake of her children she would
find it advisable to accept a proposal which would at
once remove all pecuniary anxiety. Of course, if she
knew of the probable value of the land warrant, that
would make a great difference. But Squire Turner
resolved to keep her in ignorance of this, until he had
time to settle his matrimonial plans.</p>

<p>It will now be understood why James failed to win
his father’s co-operation in his schemes of retaliation
upon Harry. It was the squire’s cue to be friendly
and conciliatory, even to our hero, who he suspected
had considerable influence over his mother, and might
use that influence to defeat his plans. In his secret
heart, however, Squire Turner disliked Harry not a
little, and would have been very glad of any little
disaster which might come to our hero. Should he
receive a beating at the hands of Tom Barton and
James, the squire would not be likely to censure
either very much.</p>

<p>That very evening something happened, which went
far to increase the dislike and aversion of the squire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to our hero, and in the end had considerable influence
upon Harry’s career.</p>

<p>It was between eleven and twelve o’clock that Mrs.
Raymond came suddenly into Harry’s room, and
waked him up.</p>

<p>“Harry,” she said, in a tone of excitement, “Katy
is taken sick, and is in great pain. I want you to
put on your clothes at once, and go as fast as you
can to Dr. Lamson’s.”</p>

<p>Harry needed no second bidding. He could hear
Katy moaning, and shared in his mother’s alarm.
He dressed in “double quick time,” and set off by
the nearest route for the house of Dr. Lamson.</p>

<p>The doctor lived at a considerable distance. By the
road it was full a mile and a quarter. But there was
a way of cutting off from a quarter to a third of a
mile by “cutting across lots.” This made the journey
rather a dark and lonely one, especially as there
was no moon, and there were but few stars out.
Harry had a stout heart and a clear conscience, and
was not easily daunted. Besides, he had his little
sister to think of, and this was enough to fill his
mind to the exclusion of anything else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>In due time he reached the doctor’s door, and
knocked. He had to repeat his knock. Upon doing
so the doctor put out his head from an upper window.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It’s I,—Harry Raymond.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, Harry. Anybody sick at home?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my sister Katy. She is in a good deal of
pain. Can you come right off?”</p>

<p>“I’ll get ready at once. Will you stop and ride
with me?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, doctor. I’ll run home and tell
mother you’re coming.”</p>

<p>“I may be there first, Harry. However, perhaps
you will feel better to go.”</p>

<p>The doctor knew that when a friend or relative is
in danger, nothing is harder to bear than passive suspense,
and that action is a relief. So he interposed
no objections to Harry’s wish.</p>

<p>Harry naturally decided to return by the same
short cut by which he had come. On the way was a
lonely old building, aloof from the road, but very
near his path, which had recently fallen into possession
of Squire Turner. It was not tenanted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
would require considerable repairs before it would be
in order to receive tenants. Ten years before, it had
been insured with a fire insurance company for an
amount below its value at that time. The insurance
had been kept up, but the value had so depreciated
that it would be a profitable thing for the proprietor
if it should be consumed by fire.</p>

<p>Squire Turner was aware of this, and in an evil
hour, under the influence of cupidity, determined to
set fire to his own building, in order to realize the
insurance money.</p>

<p>Being in a lonely situation, he thought he should
be able to set fire to the house, and return home before
the village awoke to the fact that there was a fire,
while there was not much chance of the wheezy
old engine getting to the spot in time to arrest the
conflagration.</p>

<p>Harry was a few rods from the house when his attention
was arrested by a sight which struck him
with dismay. A man muffled in an overcoat was
stooping over a basket of shavings. In a moment
there was a tiny light, proceeding from a match.
This was communicated to the shavings, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
caught at once. The man threw the basket with its
combustible contents into the house through a broken
sash, and, after pausing a moment to judge whether it
was likely to accomplish his purpose, turned swiftly
away. His coat-collar was up, and his hat was
drawn down over his face as he turned round. His
amazement may be imagined when he found that the
midnight incendiary was no other than Squire Turner
himself!</p>

<p>“What can it mean?” he thought, bewildered.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the house, which was a mere
tinder-box, was in flames, and the startled villagers,
aroused from their slumbers, saw a bright flame reflected
against the dark midnight sky.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="smaller">AFTER THE FIRE.</span></h2>

<p>By the time the fire-engine reached the burning
house, the flames were so far advanced that there was
no chance of saving it. For form’s sake, a stream of
water was thrown upon the flames from the well
near by, but the supply was soon exhausted, and produced
no effect whatever. So the engine was drawn
back to the engine-house, the crowd dispersed, and in
place of the old house there was a heap of half-burnt
rafters and cinders.</p>

<p>The next day the fire was the topic of conversation
throughout the village. Being in the store, Harry
had an opportunity of hearing it discussed by those
who “dropped in” to make purchases.</p>

<p>“Was the house insured?” asked old Sam Tilden,
filling the bowl of his pipe with tobacco, preparatory
to having a comfortable smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“I reckon it was,” said another. “The squire’s a
keerful man. He wouldn’t be likely to neglect it.”</p>

<p>“Here’s the squire himself. You can ask him,”
said John Gaylord, the chief salesman, who was
doing up half-a-dozen pounds of sugar for a customer.</p>

<p>Harry, remembering what he had seen the night
before, looked up with mingled feelings as he saw the
rather stiff and stately form of Squire Turner enter
the door.</p>

<p>The squire, though not a good-looking man, was
always carefully dressed. He regarded it as due to
his position, and as no one else in the village except
the minister and doctor were scrupulous on this
point, he inspired a certain respect on this very
account. So now, as he entered the store, in a decorous
suit of black, with a stiff standing-collar rising
above a glossy satin stock, swinging in his hand a
gold-headed cane, those present looked towards him
with considerable deference.</p>

<p>“Well, squire,” said Sam Tilden, “you met with a
misfortun’ last night.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the squire, deliberately; “there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
a clean sweep of the old house. There isn’t much
left of it.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea who sot it on fire?” queried
the old man.</p>

<p>“No,” said the squire. “I came in to see if any
one here could throw any light upon it.”</p>

<p>There was one present who could have thrown
some light upon it, and if Squire Turner had chanced
to look behind the counter he might have noticed a
peculiar expression in the eyes of Harry Raymond,
who was watching him fixedly. The fact is, Harry
was very much perplexed in his mind in regard to the
occurrence. Why a gentleman should steal out of
his house in disguise at the dead of night to set fire
to his own property was a question which was invested
with not a little mystery. But before the conversation
was finished he began to understand it
better.</p>

<p>“It must have been sot afire,” continued Sam
Tilden, positively. “There wasn’t nobody livin’ in
it.”</p>

<p>“No; it had been empty for several months.”</p>

<p>“You haint got no suspicions, I s’pose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, no,” said the squire, slowly. “I suppose
it must have been somebody that had a grudge
against me, and took this way to gratify it. But
who it may be I haven’t an idea.”</p>

<p>“I reckon it was insured?” said Sam, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the squire, cautiously; “it was insured.”</p>

<p>“I said it must be,” said one, who had spoken at
an earlier stage in the conversation. “I knew
squire, you was too keerful a man to neglect it.”</p>

<p>“It was insured when it came into my hands,”
said Squire Turner; “and I have merely kept up the
payments.”</p>

<p>“What was the figure?”</p>

<p>“I really can’t be quite certain till I have looked
at the policy,” said the squire. “I’ve got all my
houses insured, and I can’t, without looking, tell
exactly how much there is on each.”</p>

<p>“That’s the advantage of owning only one house,”
said Doctor Lamson, as he stepped in for a moment.
“I’m not liable to make a mistake about my insurance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
In what company was your house insured,
Squire Turner?”</p>

<p>“In the Phœnix Mutual, I believe. By the way,
Mr. Porter, you may send up a barrel of flour to my
house. I believe we are nearly out.”</p>

<p>“All right, squire. It shall go up in the course of
the day.”</p>

<p>“Good-morning, gentlemen,” said the squire, walking
out of the store.</p>

<p>“I guess the squire won’t lose a cent,” said Sam
Tilden, after he went out. “It’s likely the insurance
money will pay him handsome if the policy was took
out years ago. I shouldn’t wonder if he’s glad the
old house is gone. It was awfully out of repair.”</p>

<p>“Very likely you’re right,” said John Gaylord.
“I’d rather have the money than the house, for my
part.”</p>

<p>For the first time a light came to Harry’s mind.
He felt that he understood the whole matter now.
Squire Turner didn’t want the house, which would
require considerable outlay to make it habitable, and
he did want the money for which it was insured. As
the shortest way to secure this, he had himself set the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
house on fire. Now, no doubt, he meant to come
upon the company for the amount of insurance
money. To Harry’s mind this looked like a swindle,
like obtaining money by false pretences. Yet here
was Squire Turner, the richest man in the village,
occupying a very prominent—indeed the most
prominent—position in town, who was actually
going to carry out this fraud. Nobody except he
knew that the squire was himself the incendiary.
What ought he to do about it? Should he allow the
insurance company to be swindled?</p>

<p>“Do you think Squire Turner will collect his
insurance money, Mr. Gaylord?” he asked, of the
chief clerk.</p>

<p>“Do I think so? Of course he will. He’d be a
fool if he didn’t.”</p>

<p>“But people seem to think that the house wasn’t
worth as much as the sum it was insured for.”</p>

<p>“Very likely not; but it was when it was insured,
and as the payments have been kept up regular, the
insurance company can’t complain as I see.”</p>

<p>“Suppose the man that set the house on fire
should be caught?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’d be tried, and put in prison.”</p>

<p>This gave Harry something new to think of. The
idea of Squire Turner’s being put in prison was certainly
a strange and startling one. Probably it made
a difference as long as he owned the house himself.
Still, if he claimed the insurance money, that again
made a difference. Harry felt puzzled again, and in
thinking over the matter he made several ludicrous
mistakes, among others asking a boy who came in for
some molasses how many yards he would have, which
led to a mirthful explosion from the young customer,
who looked upon it as a brilliant joke.</p>

<p>Not knowing what to do, Harry did nothing. Two
days afterwards our hero saw the following placard
posted up on the outside of the store, on the left-hand
side of the door;—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">One Hundred Dollars Reward!</span>—For information

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry read this placard with interest.</p>

<p>“I could claim that reward,” he said to himself;
“but would Squire Turner think my information
worth paying for?”</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">HARRY MAKES A CALL ON BUSINESS.</span></h2>

<p>A few days later Harry heard that Squire Turner
had made a formal claim upon the Phœnix Mutual
Insurance Company for two thousand dollars, the
amount of his policy. On hearing this, he no longer
hesitated as to his duty. He resolved to call upon
the squire, and acquaint him with his information
upon the subject. Accordingly, one afternoon, he
went up to Mr. Porter, and asked for two hours’
time.</p>

<p>“What for?” queried the store-keeper.</p>

<p>“I want to call on Squire Turner. I have a little
business with him.”</p>

<p>The store-keeper naturally supposed that the business
related to the affairs of Harry’s mother, and
gave permission, as business was generally slack
about that time in the afternoon, but requested Harry
to be back by half-past three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>When Harry got started on his way to the residence
of the squire, he began to feel that his errand was
rather a delicate one. He, a mere boy, was about to
intimate to a gentleman of high social position that
he was a rascal,—that was the plain English of it,—and
was conspiring to defraud an insurance company
out of a considerable sum of money. It was rather a
bold undertaking for a boy of fifteen. Perhaps Squire
Turner might be so incensed as to kick him out of
the house. Harry was a stout boy, but still of course
he had not the strength to cope with a tall man like
the squire. Had he been a timid boy, he would have
shrunk from the encounter. But Harry was not
timid. On the contrary, he was physically and morally
brave, as anybody who knew him would readily
testify.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the risk,” he said to himself, firmly.
“I don’t think Squire Turner will think it best to
attack me.”</p>

<p>He marched manfully up the front steps, and rang
the bell. His summons was answered by a servant.</p>

<p>“Is the squire in?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply; and the girl indicated the
door of the “office.”</p>

<p>Harry knocked.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said the squire, in his usual grating
voice.</p>

<p>Harry did go in.</p>

<p>Squire Turner was seated at his desk. He had a
paper before him, which Harry rightly guessed was
the fire insurance policy. The squire had been
examining it with considerable complacency. Two
thousand dollars was a large sum even to him, and
certainly a very handsome consideration for the old
Jackson farm-house, which with the land around it he
had got, by the foreclosure of a mortgage, at a decided
bargain. How the company had ever been induced
to grant so large a sum on such a house, even in its
better days, was a wonder; but insurance companies
sometimes make mistakes as well as private individuals,
and this appeared to be one of them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus1.jpg" width="600" height="380" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“<span class="smcap">Very well, you can state your business.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>For two thousand dollars, or a little more, the
squire had been thinking he could build a nice modern
house, which would make the farm salable at a
considerably higher figure than before. This was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
very pleasant prospect, of course, and the harsh
lines in the squire’s face were smoothed out to a certain
extent as he thought of it.</p>

<p>When he turned, at the opening of the door, and
saw who his visitor was, he naturally concluded that
Harry had come about the land warrant.</p>

<p>“I haven’t heard anything more about your
mother’s Western land,” he said. “When I do I
will let you know.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Harry; “but that is not what
I have come about.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the squire, a little surprised;
“you can state your business.”</p>

<p>At this moment James Turner came in hastily.</p>

<p>“Father, I want a dollar,” he said.</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“To buy a bat and ball.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute or two. I am busy.”</p>

<p>James looked at Harry superciliously, as if to imply
that his business could not be of any particular
importance, and took a seat.</p>

<p>“You may state your business,” said the squire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Harry, looking towards
James, “but my business is private.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he wants to complain of me,” thought
James, “about the eggs. If he does he won’t make
much.”</p>

<p>“I am not aware of any business between us,” said
the squire, with dignity, “which is of too private
a nature to discuss before my son. I will, however,
stretch a point, to oblige you, and request him to
leave the room.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t on my account, but on yours,” said our
hero, bluntly, “that I wish to speak privately.”</p>

<p>Squire Turner looked at Harry in cold displeasure
not unmingled with surprise, at what he felt to be a
liberty.</p>

<p>“That’s a strange remark,” he said. “However,
James, you may leave the room. Here is the
money.”</p>

<p>“You have offered a reward, Squire Turner, for
information about the fire the other evening,” said
Harry, when they were alone, thinking it best to
plunge into the subject at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, a hundred dollars’ reward,” said the squire.
“Do you know anything about it?”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Harry, promptly.</p>

<p>Squire Turner was taken by surprise. What could
Harry know about the fire and its origin? He himself
knew all about it; but of course that knowledge
was locked up in his own breast. In offering the
reward he felt sure that it would not be claimed, and,
under the circumstances, he felt that it was well to
offer it. It would impress the fire company favorably,
as showing his determination to ferret out the secret
incendiary, and therefore he had forwarded a handbill
containing a copy of his offer to the office of the
Phœnix Mutual, together with his claim for the
amount of insurance money.</p>

<p>Harry’s prompt answer led to a suspicion in the
squire’s mind that our hero was trying to get the
reward on false pretences.</p>

<p>“The money will only be given for positive information
leading to the discovery of the incendiary,”
he said, coldly.</p>

<p>“I can give you such information,” said Harry,
with the same promptness as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said the squire, with a sneer, “you can
tell who set the house on fire.”</p>

<p>“I can,” said Harry, distinctly.</p>

<p>“Who did it?” asked the squire, beginning to feel
nervous.</p>

<p>“Squire Turner,” said our hero, feeling that the
crisis had come, “you have asked me the question,
and of course you wish me to answer it truly.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” muttered the squire, whose nervousness
increased.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Harry, firmly, “<em>you set the house on
fire yourself</em>!”</p>

<p>The words were like a thunderbolt. The squire
started to his feet, his face livid with fear, and then
purple with excitement.</p>

<p>“How dare you say such a scandalous thing?” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Because you expect me to tell the truth,” said
Harry. “If you will listen, I will tell you how I
came to know.”</p>

<p>Hereupon he gave an account, in as few words as
possible, of his midnight visit to the house of Doctor
Lamson, of his passing near the house, and identifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the squire in the act of setting fire to some shavings.
Squire Turner listened, evidently in a state
of nervous excitement, fidgeting about in a manner
which indicated his mental disturbance. When
Harry had finished, he spoke.</p>

<p>“This is the most impudent fabrication I ever
heard. You mean to charge that I—a rich man,
and, if I say it myself, universally respected—actually
set fire to my own house at the dead of night!”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Harry, firmly.</p>

<p>“I have a great mind to kick you out of my
house,” said the squire, violently.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you will do it, Squire Turner,” said
Harry, who did not show a trace of alarm.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because I have told the truth, and you know it,”
said our hero, “and if I told it outside, people might
believe it.”</p>

<p>“What would your word weigh against mine?”
said the squire, but his tone was more confident than
his feeling.</p>

<p>“I never told a lie, as everybody in the village will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
testify,” said Harry, proudly. “Of course it is an
object for you to deny it.”</p>

<p>The squire began to see that the overbearing policy
was not exactly the one to pursue in this case.
Harry was not to be frightened easily, and this he
realized. Besides, there were other reasons why he
did not wish to fall out with our hero. Accordingly
he thought proper to change his tone.</p>

<p>“My young friend,” he said, with a very significant
change of tone and manner, “you are certainly
under a very strange delusion. I should be angry,
but I am rather disposed to be amused. You would
only be laughed at if you should spread abroad such
a ridiculous tale.”</p>

<p>“It’s true,” persisted Harry.</p>

<p>“Consider a moment,” said Squire Turner, with
commendable patience, “the nature of your charge.
It is rather absurd that I should set fire to my own
building,—isn’t it, now? What possible object
could I have in so doing?”</p>

<p>“The insurance,” briefly answered Harry.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Squire Turner, slowly; “the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
was insured, to be sure, but they don’t insure to the
full value.”</p>

<p>“Everybody says that the house was insured for
more than its full value.”</p>

<p>“Quite a mistake. I would rather have the house
than the money. In fact, it was quite a disappointment
having the house burnt down.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Harry, sturdily.
“All I know is, that I saw you setting the house on
fire with my own eyes.”</p>

<p>Perspiration began to come out on the squire’s
brow. He had never anticipated such an obstacle to
the carrying out his plans, and it did seem a little
provoking when everything had seemed so favorable
hitherto. He would like to have pitched our hero
out of the window, or kicked him out of the house;
but neither course seemed quite expedient. So,
though boiling over with inward wrath and vexation,
he forced himself to be conciliatory.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt you think you are right,” he
said; “but in the evening one is easily deceived
about faces. I was fast asleep at the time, and,
indeed, I knew nothing of the fire till my house-keeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
came and knocked at my door when it was
nearly over.”</p>

<p>This was partly true; but the squire didn’t say
that it was just after he had crept stealthily into the
house.</p>

<p>“Still, as I am a friend of your family, and interested
in your welfare,” he continued, “I don’t mind
giving you the hundred dollars, not, of course, as a
reward, but to help you along. Of course it is on
condition that you say nothing of this ridiculous
story. It would only involve you in trouble. Come
up to-morrow and I’ll give you the money.”</p>

<p>“Squire Turner,” said Harry, promptly, “I cannot
accept your proposition, or money.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because my story, whether ridiculous or not, is
true. I don’t care for the reward; I didn’t come up
here to get it.”</p>

<p>“What did you come for?”</p>

<p>“I came to prevent your coming upon the insurance
company for that money. If you will promise
not to ask for the money, I will never say a word
about how the fire came about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can’t promise that,” said the squire; “but
before claiming the insurance I will let you know.
In the mean time you had better keep the story to
yourself.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Harry, and, rising, he left the room,
leaving the squire in a very uncomfortable and unsatisfactory
state of mind.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="smaller">HARTLEY BRANDON.</span></h2>

<p>When the squire was left alone, he began rather
ruefully to think over the unexpected turn which
affairs had taken. If he had disliked Harry before,
he hated him now. He felt that the sturdy determination
of our young hero was likely to place him in a
very unpleasant dilemma. If he should not collect
the insurance money, the house would be a total loss,
and this would be very provoking. If he should collect
it, he had every reason to believe that Harry
would keep his word; and, as he was a boy of truth,
many would no doubt believe him, and the insurance
company would be sure to stir in the matter. There
was another consideration. If he guiltily let the
matter pass, and failed to make his claim, or recalled
it,—for it was already made,—it would excite a
great deal of surprise, and perhaps suspicion, and
thus again he would be disagreeably situated. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
seemed to be only a choice of difficulties, as the
squire realized. He fervently wished now that he
had never burnt the house down. But it was done
and could not be undone.</p>

<p>“I wish the young rascal was out of the way,” he
muttered to himself.</p>

<p>He wished it the more because Harry stood in the
way of another plan which he had in view, namely,
marrying Mrs. Raymond, in case the Western property
proved as valuable as he anticipated. He had
an instinctive feeling that our hero would not fancy
him for a step-father, and would exert all his influence
over his mother to prevent her accepting him,
even if she might otherwise be willing.</p>

<p>“Plague take the young whelp!” muttered the
squire. “I wish he was in Nova Zembla, or somewhere
else, where he would never come back.”</p>

<p>His uncomfortable reflections were here broken in
upon by the entrance of the servant.</p>

<p>“There’s a man at the door wants to see you,
Squire Turner.”</p>

<p>“Who is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s a stranger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, tell him to come in.”</p>

<p>The invitation was duly given, and directly there
entered a tall man, very seedy in his appearance,
with a repulsive aspect, who looked as if the world
and he had not been on good terms for some time.
He was probably about the same age as Squire Turner,—that
is, fifty,—but looked still older, probably
in consequence of the life he had led.</p>

<p>Squire Turner looked at the intruder in surprise.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Squire Turner?” said the
stranger, familiarly.</p>

<p>“You have the advantage of me,” said the squire,
coldly.</p>

<p>“Yet you used to know me well,” was the reply,
as the visitor sat down uninvited.</p>

<p>“I don’t know you now. Who are you?” demanded
Squire Turner, who didn’t feel it necessary
to use much ceremony with a man so evidently under
the frowns of fortune.</p>

<p>“I am your cousin, Hartley Brandon.”</p>

<p>Squire Turner started.</p>

<p>“Hartley Brandon!” he repeated, in amazement.
“I thought you were dead years ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“And wished it, no doubt,” said the other, with a
laugh. “Confess now you are not very glad to see
me.”</p>

<p>“I am not very glad to see you, as you are sharp
enough to guess,” said the squire, with a sneer.
“You are not a relative to be proud of.”</p>

<p>“True enough,” said the other. “I see you are
not afraid of hurting my feelings. However, I’ve
had so many hard rubs that my feelings have got
worn off, if I ever had any.”</p>

<p>“What is your object in coming down here, for I
suppose you have an object?”</p>

<p>“Suppose I say that it is for the sake of seeing
about the only relative I have in the world. There’s
something in that, you know.”</p>

<p>“Not in this case. We may be cousins, but we
are not friends, and never will be.”</p>

<p>“Come, that’s frank,—true, too, I dare say,” said
Hartley Brandon, who didn’t appear by any means
disturbed at the coldness of the squire. “Well, as
you say, it wasn’t that. Blood’s thicker than water,
they say, but there are plenty of people I like better
than you, who are my cousin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is a matter of perfect indifference to me,”
said the squire, coldly. “I don’t want to know what
your object is not, but what it is.”</p>

<p>“I am rather seedy, as you see.”</p>

<p>“So it appears.”</p>

<p>“This shabby suit, with half a dollar, constitutes
all my worldly possessions.”</p>

<p>“Supposing it to be so, what is that to me?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you help me a little?”</p>

<p>The squire’s mouth tightened, as it always did
when there was an attack on his purse-strings. He
seldom gave away money, unless he thought it would
help him in some way, and he felt even more than
usually unwilling to do so at a time when, owing to
Harry’s obduracy, he was threatened with a serious
loss. No poorer time could have been selected by
his cousin for his application than this.</p>

<p>“I can do nothing for you,” he said, coldly.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean you to give me money,” said Brandon.
“I only want an advance of thirty or forty
dollars, which I will faithfully repay you with interest.”</p>

<p>Squire Turner laughed scornfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“What security can you offer?” he asked.</p>

<p>“None at all, except my word.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t satisfactory.”</p>

<p>“I thought you’d say so; but listen, and I will
tell you how the matter stands. First, I suppose
you would like to know how I have been employed
for the last twenty odd years.”</p>

<p>“You may tell or not, just as you like. I feel no
particular interest in the matter.”</p>

<p>“I have followed the sea,—I see you are surprised;
but this is the way it happened. Twenty-five
years since, I found myself high and dry in New
York, with no resources, and nobody to look to for
help. In my distress I fell in with a sailor, who
treated me kindly, and proposed to me to adopt his
profession. It was not particularly to my taste, and
I knew it was rather late in life to begin; but I had
no other resource, and I allowed myself to be persuaded.
I had a hard time of it at first, as you may
suppose, but after a while I became acquainted with
my duties, and turned out a very fair sailor. Being
possessed of a better education than belongs to the
generality of seamen, I found myself able to rise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
On the second voyage, I shipped third mate. Then I
rose to second mate; finally to first mate. I might
have become captain if I had been a little more
steady, but a fondness for drink stood in the way of
my advancement.”</p>

<p>“So you have been a sailor for twenty-five
years.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It was no doubt the best thing you could do.
You don’t think of giving it up?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see what I can do for you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a chance to sail as mate next week in the
ship Sea Eagle bound for China.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go, then?”</p>

<p>“Because there’s a trifle in the way. I owe
twenty-five dollars in New York, and if I don’t pay
it up square the party’ll put a spoke in my wheel, and
prevent my getting the situation.”</p>

<p>“So you want me to advance you the necessary
money?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll pay you back at the end of the voyage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you know the captain under whom you are
to sail?” asked the squire, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, a little.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a man is he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, an average sort of a man,—rather a Tartar,
so I hear from some who have sailed under him. He
likes his ease, and leaves the vessel pretty much in
the hands of his first officer.”</p>

<p>A train of reflection had been started in the
squire’s mind by the communication of his kinsman.
He wanted to be rid of Harry Raymond. Why
could he not arrange with Hartley Brandon to
smuggle him off to sea, where he would be out of
the way of interfering with his plans? It might be
difficult to manage, but no doubt some way would
suggest itself. As for Brandon, there was no fear
of his refusing. He was not troubled with scruples,
and a small sum of money would buy his co-operation.</p>

<p>Then, again, the sea was a treacherous element.
Accidents were frequent. Should Harry once embark
on its smooth but fickle expanse, he might
never come back again, or, if he did, it might be to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
find him, the squire, his mother’s second husband,
and the relationship would seal his lips from disclosing
the secret of which he had become possessed.</p>

<p>All these thoughts passed through the squire’s
mind much more quickly than I have been able to
state them. The plan which has been briefly
sketched seemed the only way out of the labyrinth
in which he had become involved, and he resolved
to make a trial of it.</p>

<p>“Well, will you help me?” asked Brandon, growing
impatient of his kinsman’s silence.</p>

<p>“I will,” answered the squire, “upon conditions.”</p>

<p>“Name them,” said Brandon, brightening up.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">A LETTER FROM NEW YORK.</span></h2>

<p>It is unnecessary to detail the conversation which
took place between Squire Turner and Hartley Brandon,
since the nature of it may be guessed from the
events which followed. As might be expected, Brandon
was by no means squeamish, and made no objection
to what was proposed. Indeed, he made an
occasional suggestion which was adopted by his kinsman.
The squire did not, of course, think it politic
to reveal the real causes of his hostility to Harry,
nor of the reasons which he had for desiring that the
boy should be out of the way.</p>

<p>He was too cautious a man for this, and moreover
had too little confidence in Brandon, whom he regarded
as an unprincipled fellow, being in this
opinion not far from right. He merely said that he
had reasons for wishing Harry out of the way, and
expressed his willingness, should matters turn out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
satisfactorily, not only to make Hartley a present
advance of fifty dollars, but to pay him over a further
sum of five hundred when the affair was over, besides
what might be needed for preliminary expenses.</p>

<p>To the shiftless vagabond, who had been tossing
about the ocean for a quarter of a century, five hundred
dollars was a large sum, though we may consider
it a trifling compensation for an act of villany.
So he readily promised the squire his co-operation.</p>

<p>“It is best that you should leave Vernon at once,”
said the squire, when the arrangements between them
were concluded.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Brandon, rather disappointed, for
he fully expected to be the squire’s guest till the next
day.</p>

<p>“Because it won’t do for you to be seen by the
boy. He would recognize you when you meet in the
city, and this might lead him to suspect something
wrong.”</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do?”</p>

<p>“I will have my horse harnessed to the carryall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and will take you over to the Wrexham station,
where you can take the cars for the city.”</p>

<p>“What time do the cars start?”</p>

<p>“In a couple of hours. We have no time to lose.”</p>

<p>“Have you got anything eatable in the house?
I’m almost famished. Haven’t eaten anything since
early this morning.”</p>

<p>“I will look to that. Stay here, or rather I will
lead the way upstairs. Some one might be in.
How will some beefsteak suit you?”</p>

<p>“Just the thing. Only let there be plenty of it.
I’ve got a famous appetite.”</p>

<p>Brandon was conducted upstairs to a back room
on the second floor, where the squire suggested that
he might as well fill up a portion of the time till
lunch by brushing his clothes, and performing ablutions
which appeared to be needful. He then went
downstairs to give the necessary directions to Mrs.
Murray.</p>

<p>“Broil some beefsteak and plenty of it,” said the
squire. “You may boil two or three eggs also, and
send up a loaf of bread and some butter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where shall I set the table?” asked Mrs. Murray.</p>

<p>“Never mind about a table. You can carry all
up on a waiter to the back chamber when ready.”</p>

<p>Seeing that the house-keeper looked surprised, he
added, in rather an embarrassed way:—</p>

<p>“The fact is, the man was a school-mate of mine,
who hasn’t turned out very well. Out of pity, I am
going to help him a little, but don’t care about his
being seen in my house.”</p>

<p>This seemed plausible enough, particularly when
Mrs. Murray saw Brandon, who certainly looked
very much like one who had not turned out very
well. The rapid manner in which the abundant
meal melted away under his vigorous attacks was
certainly a tribute to the culinary skill of the house-keeper,
who was led to form a more favorable estimate
of the shabby stranger in consequence.</p>

<p>In a little more than half an hour Squire Turner
was on his way to Wrexham, Brandon occupying a
back seat. They reached the depot ten minutes
before the train arrived, so that there was ample
time to buy a ticket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>So the train was set in motion that was to lead
to important changes in the life of our young hero.
These it shall be our task gradually to unfold, and
set on record.</p>

<p>Four days passed quietly. The villagers had
ceased to talk of the fire, as another exciting occurrence
had succeeded. Deacon Watson had been
thrown out of his carriage and broken his leg, and
the details of this accident were still fresh in the
mouths of all.</p>

<p>Harry pursued the even tenor of his way in his
new position, trying to make himself as useful as
possible, and succeeding to the satisfaction of his
employer. Always prompt, always reliable, Mr.
Porter felt that in spite of his youth he fully filled
the place of Alfred Harper, whose temporary loss he
now regarded with equanimity.</p>

<p>Harry was weighing some sugar for a customer
one afternoon when John Gaylord, who had just got
through sorting the mail, said to him, “Here’s a
letter for your mother, mailed at New York.”</p>

<p>“Let me see it,” said Harry, who felt some curiosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
as to who might have written to his mother, for
her correspondence was very limited.</p>

<p>He took the letter in his hand, and looked at the
direction. It was in a dashing business-hand, quite
unknown to him, and revealed nothing.</p>

<p>“I will take it home when I go to supper,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Has your mother got friends in New York?”
asked Gaylord.</p>

<p>“Not that I know of. I don’t recognize the handwriting.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a lawyer’s letter, informing her of a
legacy,” said the senior clerk, jocosely.</p>

<p>“Very probable,” said Harry, smiling.</p>

<p>It was already the hour when he usually returned
for supper. Accordingly he put on his cap and went
out of the store. Being a little curious as to the
contents of the letter, he hastened his steps, and
entered the house out of breath.</p>

<p>“You’re a little early,” said his mother. “Supper
isn’t quite ready.”</p>

<p>“I hurried, because a letter came by this afternoon’s
mail. It’s mailed at New York.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“New York!” repeated Mrs. Raymond, in surprise.
“Who can it be from?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Haven’t you any friends there?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of. Harry, you may take up
the tea and toast, while I am reading the letter.”</p>

<p>She tore open the envelope, and first, as was natural,
turned to the bottom of the second page, and
read the name appended to the letter.</p>

<p>“Lemuel Fairchild!” she repeated, thoughtfully.
“I don’t recall the name.”</p>

<p>“Read it aloud, mother,” said Harry.</p>

<p>She complied with his request.</p>

<p>This is the way the letter read:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">No. — Nassau Street, Room 7.<br />
New York, Nov. 7, 18—.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>:—Though personally a stranger
to you, I knew your husband well, and have heard
with the deepest regret of his sad fate. We had not
met for years, but I have always cherished a warm regard
for him, though on account of the absorption of
my time by important business I have not been able
to keep up a correspondence with him. But, without
further preface, I will come to my object in writing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“If I remember rightly, you have a son who must
now be a boy of sixteen or thereabouts. No doubt
you are anxious to get him into some kind of
employment. In the country I am aware desirable
opportunities are rare, and I presume you are at a
loss how to secure him one. Now, I am desirous of
taking a boy, and training him in my own business.
Having no one in view, it has occurred to me that it
might be a pleasant arrangement for you as well as
for me, if I should take your son. I may add that
I am a commission merchant, doing a large business.
Can you send him up at once? As to wages, I will
give him twelve dollars a week at first. He will
not earn half that, but I shall feel that, in overpaying
him, I shall be assisting the widow and son
of my old friend.</p>

<p class="center">“Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Lemuel Fairchild</span>.</p>

<p>“If you accept my proposal, I should like to see
your son at my office some time Monday.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Raymond looked at Harry in perplexity,
after finishing the letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lemuel Fairchild!” she repeated. “It is
strange I never heard your father speak of him.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he may have done so, and you do not
recall the name.”</p>

<p>“It may be so,” said Mrs. Raymond, slowly, “but
I do not think so.”</p>

<p>“At any rate,” said Harry, “it’s a splendid offer.
Think of earning twelve dollars a week, to begin
with, in New York!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a good offer, but how can I spare you?”
said his mother, sorrowfully. “It will be very lonely
without you. Don’t you think you had better
remain in Mr. Porter’s store?”</p>

<p>“That will only be for a few weeks, you know,
mother. Alfred Harper will be getting well before
long, and then I shall be out of a situation. I think
we had better say yes.”</p>

<p>Harry’s ambition was fired by the prospect of a
place in the city. Like many another country boy
he had the most splendid visions of what city life
was. By the side of a position in a city office his
present situation looked mean and contemptible.
Even had the pay been the same, he would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
preferred New York to Vernon; but the fact that
the salary offered in the city was just double was
an additional inducement. Why, John Gaylord,
Mr. Porter’s chief salesman, though already twenty-five
years of age, and with several years’ experience
as clerk, received just that, and no more. That
Harry should be offered the same salary at fifteen
was indeed a compliment.</p>

<p>“I expect board is higher in the city,” said Mrs.
Raymond.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose it is; but next year I shall
probably have my pay raised. Who knows but
I may get into the firm some day,” said Harry,
glowing with enthusiasm, “and make money hand
over hand? Then I can take a nice house in the
city, and you and Katy can come up and live with
me. Won’t that be nice?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond confessed that it would be nice.
Still she did not like to let Harry go. But he
gradually won her to his side, and she admitted that
there was something in his arguments. So, before
he went back to the store, it was virtually agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
between them that the offer was not one to be
refused.</p>

<p>“Let me take the letter, mother,” said Harry.
“I would like to show it to Mr. Gaylord and Mr.
Porter.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">HARRY ARRIVES IN THE CITY.</span></h2>

<p>On going back to the store, Harry showed the
senior salesman the letter his mother had received.</p>

<p>Now John Gaylord was in the main a good-natured
young man, but he was not without the
failings incident to humanity. It happened that he
had himself been secretly desirous of going to the
city, and obtaining some position which promised
better than that of chief salesman in a country
store. But he had no friends to help him in New
York, and he was wise enough to feel that it would
not be expedient to throw up a fair place in the
country for the uncertain prospect of one in the
city. But, for all that, he used to think oftentimes
that his business abilities deserved something better
than weighing out tea and sugar in small quantities
for country customers. So when he learned that
Harry Raymond, an inexperienced boy, had received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
an offer which he would gladly have accepted himself,
he naturally felt a little envious, and provoked
with Harry for his good fortune.</p>

<p>“What do you think of it, Mr. Gaylord?” asked
Harry.</p>

<p>“I think you had better stay where you are,” was
the unsatisfactory reply.</p>

<p>This was rather a damper to Harry, who had
expected to be congratulated.</p>

<p>“Why?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Because you’re a mere boy, and can’t expect to
earn twelve dollars a week.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t suppose I shall at first; but then,
you see, Mr. Fairchild was a friend of my father.”</p>

<p>“But, when he finds that you don’t earn your
money, he’ll get dissatisfied with you, and send you
home.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Harry, stoutly.
“I mean to do my best.”</p>

<p>“You have no experience.”</p>

<p>“I shall get it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, suit yourself,” said the young man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
“only if it turns out as I tell you, you mustn’t be
surprised.”</p>

<p>Harry made no reply, being rather offended at
the manner in which his communication had been
received. He did not suspect that John Gaylord
was secretly envying him all the while, and contrasting
his own poor prospects very discontentedly with
Harry’s. But he was not in the least discouraged.
He had faith in himself, and felt sure that if he did
his best, as he meant to, he should get on well
enough. He gave Mr. Porter notice that he should
leave him at the end of the week. The latter
congratulated him on his good prospects, and
expressed satisfaction with his services while in
his employ.</p>

<p>The next day, as if by accident, Squire Turner
entered the store, and, advancing to the counter
behind which Harry was standing, said with unusual
graciousness:—</p>

<p>“Well, my young friend, how are you getting
on?”</p>

<p>“Very well, thank you, sir,” said Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think Mr. Porter may find it for his interest
to engage you permanently.”</p>

<p>“I have accepted another situation,” said our
hero, with a little excusable importance.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said the squire, in assumed surprise.
“In Vernon?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, in New York.”</p>

<p>“I am surprised to hear it. It is not easy to
obtain a situation in the city. How did you hear
of it?”</p>

<p>“A friend of my father’s, a commission merchant
in Nassau Street, wrote to my mother, yesterday,
offering it to me.”</p>

<p>“What is his name? I may know him.”</p>

<p>“Lemuel Fairchild.”</p>

<p>“Lemuel Fairchild,” repeated the squire, slowly.
“I don’t recognize the name. So you are going to
accept it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am going up Monday morning. I am to
have twelve dollars a week.”</p>

<p>“An excellent salary. Well, I am glad to hear
you are so fortunate. When I go up to the city, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
will call and see how you are getting along.
What is the number?”</p>

<p>Harry gave the address, which the squire copied
down in his pocket-book, and with a friendly salutation
left the store. He had found out what he
wanted to know, that the decoy letter had been
received, and that the plan was likely to work well.</p>

<p>“He has swallowed the bait,” he said to himself,
with satisfaction. “I hope the rest of the plan will
work as well. I shall not dare to draw my insurance
money till he is out of the way.”</p>

<p>The cordial manner of the squire impressed Harry
rather favorably. In fact, he felt very much puzzled
about him. It seemed hard to believe that he was
meditating a fraud upon the insurance company.
But, as might be expected, his own affairs occupied
the greater portion of his thoughts, which was just
what Squire Turner wished. The change in his
mode of life was so great and so important that he
could scarcely think of anything else. Besides,
there were preparations to be made for his departure.
He needed a new suit of clothes. It would
be inconvenient to pay for them now, but the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
tailor readily promised to give him a four weeks’
credit until he should be able to pay him out of
his wages in his new place. This suit was to cost
twenty dollars, and so good progress was made in
getting it ready that Harry was able to wear it on
Sunday to church, where he received the congratulations
of his friends and school-mates.</p>

<p>As Harry had never been to New York, he was
placed under the care of a gentleman who proposed
going to the city on Monday.</p>

<p>He was up bright and early, having slept little, if
the truth must be told, on account of the excitement
which he felt. His mother was up, of course, also,
and prepared a better breakfast than usual.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how I shall get along without you,
Harry,” she said, despondently. “The house will be
lonely.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll come home soon to pass Sunday, mother,”
said Harry. “Besides, you shall hear from me; I’ll
write twice a week, regularly. Then you’ll know I’m
doing well.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’ll get run over in the streets; they
are so crowded with wagons.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry only laughed at this.</p>

<p>“Don’t fear,” he said. “I’m old enough to take
care of myself. You forget how old I am, mother.”</p>

<p>“You’re only fifteen.”</p>

<p>“A boy of fifteen ought to be smart enough not to
get run over. You see, mother, you’re a woman, and
don’t know much about boys. I’ll do well enough,
and you’ll feel better about my going away, soon.”</p>

<p>What Harry said was partly true. If the situation
which he intended to fill had been a genuine
one, his pluck and good principle would have been
likely to insure his success. But he little knew what
a plot had been formed against him, and what a
series of adventures lay before him ere he would
again see his mother and home. Could he have foreseen
all this, brave as he was, he might well have
quailed. But he supposed that all was fair and
aboveboard, and that he would have nothing to
encounter beyond the usual experiences of a boy in a
city counting-room.</p>

<p>Time never waits for any one, and the hour of
parting came. Harry hastily embraced his mother
and little sister, and with a certain swelling of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
heart which he could not quite repress, hurried out
into the road to the carriage which was to convey him
to the railroad station.</p>

<p>Mr. Falkland, his companion, was not a resident
of Vernon, but had visited the place on business, and
had readily undertaken to act as Harry’s guardian as
far as the city. He spoke civilly to our hero, and
asked him how he expected to like the city. But
after getting into the cars, he took out a book and
began to read. Harry took a seat behind, where he
could look out of the window, and was sufficiently
interested in watching the varied scenery through
which he was whirled rapidly by the cars. His
spirits began to rise once more, and bright dreams
of the success he was going to achieve in the city
swept across his mental vision. He was undecided
whether, when he got rich, which he confidently
hoped to be at twenty-five, he would install his
mother in a nice house in the city, or build a house
for her in Vernon, say as large as Squire Turner’s.
However, as he wisely concluded, there was no immediate
necessity for deciding about this. He might
leave it subject to further reflection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>So the train whirled on at the rate of twenty-five
miles an hour, and in about two hours he found the
houses growing more and more numerous, until the
cars came to a final pause in the New York depot.</p>

<p>Mr. Falkland put his book into his carpet-bag.</p>

<p>“You have never been in the city before, I think,”
he said.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then, of course, you don’t know the way anywhere.
I’ll go with you at once to Nassau Street
(that’s the place, I believe), and then you’ll be all
right.”</p>

<p>Harry was a little bewildered by the strangeness
and novelty of the scenes to which he was introduced.
So this was the great city of which he had heard so
much. It was here that he was to work his way.
Most boys would have felt a momentary depression
and loss of confidence, but Harry had a good deal of
faith and courage.</p>

<p>“Plenty of men succeed here,” he said to himself;
“and I’m bound to succeed too.”</p>

<p>Just then his courage was reinforced by the
thought of his motto, and he repeated to himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
“‘Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish,’”
closing the quotation in a manner suited to his circumstances
and determination.</p>

<p>After a while they reached Nassau Street, and the
number which was mentioned in the letter.</p>

<p>“What is Mr. Fairchild’s business?” inquired Mr.
Falkland.</p>

<p>“He is a commission merchant.”</p>

<p>His companion looked rather surprised at this
statement, as Nassau Street is scarcely the place
where a commission merchant would be likely to
establish himself. However, he did not feel called
upon to express any opinion on the subject to Harry.
It was, no doubt, all right, and he had business of
his own to occupy his thoughts. As long as he conducted
Harry safely to his destination, he would
have done all that he had agreed to do.</p>

<p>They paused at the foot of the staircase, at the
bottom of which, on either side, was a sort of directory
of names occupying the apartments above.
Opposite No. 7 was the name, Lemuel Fairchild.</p>

<p>Harry pointed it out to his companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is the right name, is it?” asked Mr. Falkland.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you won’t have any trouble in
finding it. You don’t need me to go up with you, do
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir,” said our hero, promptly. “I’m all
right now.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, then.”</p>

<p>“Good-by. I thank you for your care of me.”</p>

<p>Harry shook hands with Mr. Falkland, and ascended
the stairs. The staircase was rather narrow,
and not particularly clean. It did not look quite so
magnificent as Harry had anticipated, whose ideas
of places of business in the city were rather brighter
than the reality. But, then, he reflected that people
at any rate got rich in the city, and that was the
main point.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the head of the stairs he saw
four doors, the highest number, of course, going up to
4. It would be necessary to climb another flight.
This he did, and found himself very soon standing
before No. 7. He was not quite sure whether he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
ought to knock, or go directly in. On the whole, he
thought it best to knock.</p>

<p>“Come in!” said a voice from within.</p>

<p>Harry opened the door, and found himself in the
presence of his employer.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW THEY DO BUSINESS IN THE CITY.</span></h2>

<p>The room into which Harry entered was possibly
twenty feet square, and had rather a desolate look.
It was poorly lighted, having but one window, looking
upon a court-yard. At one end was an elevated
desk, with a large ledger lying upon it. There were
two arm-chairs in the office, on one of which a man
of forty-five sat smoking a cigar. He was rather a
hard-featured man, with stiff, wiry, black hair, and
rather a seedy look.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Fairchild in?” asked our hero, dubiously.</p>

<p>“I am Mr. Fairchild,” was the unexpected reply.
“Are you young Raymond?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Harry, feeling considerably
disappointed with the appearance of his employer as
well as the office in which he was to work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="600" height="380" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“<span class="smcap">Is Mr. Fairchild in?</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>The fact was, he had formed a very different idea
of both from the present reality. He supposed Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Fairchild would be a portly man, handsomely
dressed, and his place of business a large warehouse
several times as large as Mr. Porter’s store, which he
had just left. But here was a miserable little twenty-foot
room, at which, he felt very confident, John
Gaylord would turn up his nose. He fervently hoped
that none of his country friends would come and see
him. After all the glowing anticipations he had
formed, this was certainly something of a come-down.
Then, he was disappointed in Mr. Fairchild himself.
He certainly did not look by any means like a prosperous
city merchant, doing an extensive business.</p>

<p>“Have you just reached New York, Raymond?”
asked the merchant, picking his teeth with the small
blade of his pocket-knife.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Harry. “I came right here.”</p>

<p>“All right. I was expecting you. So you want
me to make a business man of you, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Harry, wondering if he should
dress as shabbily when he became a commission merchant.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll do my best for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“How is business, sir?” asked Harry, a little
anxiously under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“Pretty good,” answered Mr. Fairchild.</p>

<p>Harry involuntarily looked round the empty room
with a puzzled air. He wondered what Mr. Fairchild
had to sell, and where he kept it. He could not
help wondering, also, where his salary of twelve dollars
a week was to come from.</p>

<p>“Yesterday I sold a cargo of sugar,” resumed Mr.
Fairchild,—“ten thousand dollars’ worth. I must
have you make out the bill presently.”</p>

<p>Harry looked and felt astonished. He began to
suspect that, in spite of appearances, considerable
business might be done even in this little room.
Probably Mr. Porter’s sales for an entire year would
not amount to more than twenty thousand dollars,
yet here was a sale of half that amount in a single
day.</p>

<p>“Do you often make such large sales?” he asked,
with a new feeling of respect.</p>

<p>“Do you call that a large sale?” said the merchant,
indifferently.</p>

<p>“I should think it was, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, yes, your being from the country explains
that. I sell large quantities of merchandise on commission.
I never take any consignment worth less
than a thousand dollars. It wouldn’t pay.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said our hero, becoming more cheerful.
The office was small and dull. Still the amount of
business done there redeemed its significance.</p>

<p>“Day before yesterday I sold a cargo of cotton,
amounting to—let me see—”</p>

<p>Mr. Fairchild went to the desk, and, opening it,
took out a small blank book.</p>

<p>“Twenty-seven thousand five hundred and thirty
three dollars, and seventy-five cents,” he read, from
the book. “What would my commission on this
sale be, at two per cent.? I want to see whether you
are quick and correct at figures.”</p>

<p>“About five hundred and fifty dollars,” answered
our hero, making a rapid calculation in his head.
“If I had a pencil and some paper, I would give you
the exact figures.”</p>

<p>“Quite right. I see you understand the principle.
That’s doing very fairly for one day, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Harry, considerably impressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment a man entered, and, with a hasty
glance at Harry, addressed Mr. Fairchild.</p>

<p>“Ah, Miller, how are you?” said the merchant.</p>

<p>“Very well, but in a great hurry. Have you sold
that cargo of silks yet?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>“Have you thought over my offer of this morning?”</p>

<p>“Seventeen thousand dollars? Yes, I have thought
of it, and I can’t accept it. My price is eighteen
thousand.”</p>

<p>“Too much; but I’ll tell you what I’ll do, I’ll split
the difference, and say five hundred.”</p>

<p>This offer, after a little chaffering, was finally
agreed to.</p>

<p>“Raymond,” said Mr. Fairchild, “make out a bill
against Mr. Miller, Thomas Miller, of seventeen
thousand five hundred dollars for the cargo of silks, at
present on the ship Argo. You will find pen and
paper on the desk.”</p>

<p>Harry stepped to the desk, and with some tribulation
made out the bill, as he would have done for
a supply of groceries. He feared that it would not
answer; but on handing it to Mr. Fairchild that gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
made no criticism. He just glanced at it,
and handed it to Mr. Miller.</p>

<p>“Very well, I’ll send round a check for the amount
in the morning.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“Good-morning. I am in a hurry;” and the silk
purchaser went out.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that specimen of doing
business, Raymond?” asked Mr. Fairchild, complacently.</p>

<p>“It didn’t take long.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s the city style. And it pays too.
Just calculate the commission on that sale at two per
cent.”</p>

<p>“Three hundred and fifty dollars,” said our hero,
promptly.</p>

<p>“I dare say you are not used to such transactions
in the country.”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a very comfortable way of doing business.
Probably I may have no other sale to-day—possibly
not to-morrow; but two or three large sales
a week count up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry began to think he should not have to work
very hard, and his doubt as to Mr. Fairchild’s making
money enough to pay him his wages disappeared.</p>

<p>“Do you want me to go to work at once?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have some copying for you to do. Open
that ledger.”</p>

<p>Harry did so.</p>

<p>“You may commence at page 51, and copy down
the entries upon these sheets of paper. You are
used to copying, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, but I can do it well enough.”</p>

<p>“Very well. You may go to work at once. I
must make a business call. I will be back in an
hour or two, and take you to dinner.”</p>

<p>He took his hat and went out. Harry began to
copy industriously. The transactions entered appeared
to date several years back, and Harry did not
exactly understand what connection they had with
Mr. Lemuel Fairchild’s business. But then, as he
reflected, he was not competent to judge of that. All
he had to do was to obey instructions, and after
a while he would know more. It was certainly very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
astonishing the way in which business was done in
the city. The prospect of being cooped up in a small,
dark room was not very pleasant. Still Harry recalled
the pleasant circumstance that he was earning
two dollars a day, and was at the same time learning
business. So far as he could see, the commission
business was not very difficult to learn. Perhaps
Mr. Fairchild might eventually admit him as a partner
in the firm. If so, he would soon realize a fortune.</p>

<p>Harry kept on copying steadily while these
thoughts were passing through his mind. After an
hour or more the door opened, and Mr. Fairchild
entered.</p>

<p>“How much have you copied?” he asked, advancing
to the desk.</p>

<p>“About two pages and a half,” said Harry. “Is
it done right?”</p>

<p>His employer glanced at the writing carelessly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “it will do very well. You have
a good business-hand.”</p>

<p>“I shall improve as I go on, I hope,” said Harry,
modestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, of course. I’ve no doubt I shall be able to
make a business-man of you. But I suppose you are
getting hungry.”</p>

<p>Harry admitted that he was a little hungry.</p>

<p>“Well, we will go out as soon as a friend arrives
whom I have invited to accompany us.”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes after, the friend referred to
arrived. It was Hartley Brandon,—the same man
who had visited Squire Turner in Vernon the week
before.</p>

<p>He glanced sharply at our hero, and said something
in a low tone to Mr. Fairchild which Harry did not
understand. He little dreamed that the new-comer
was to be intimately connected with his fortunes.
Still less did he dream that he was an agent of
Squire Turner, and that all the profitable business
transactions of Mr. Lemuel Fairchild were merely
fictitious, and got up solely to deceive him. Harry
was a smart boy, but even smart boys are likely to
be taken in, in matters of which they have no previous
experience. But Harry’s eyes were to be
opened very soon.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">HARRY’S FIRST BUSINESS TRANSACTION.</span></h2>

<p>Lemuel Fairchild conducted Brandon and Harry
to Lovejoy’s Hotel on Broadway, and led the way to
the restaurant connected with the hotel.</p>

<p>“I’ve done a good stroke of business this morning,”
he said. “I can afford to stand treat. Sit
down, Mr. Brandon. Sit down, Raymond. Now,
what will you have?”</p>

<p>“Roast beef,” answered Brandon. “I prefer the
sirloin.”</p>

<p>“Very good. What for you, Raymond?”</p>

<p>“The same,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Three plates of sirloin,” ordered Mr. Fairchild.
“By the way, Captain Brandon, I have been giving
our young friend here a little inkling into the way we
do business in the city.”</p>

<p>“Well, my lad,” said Brandon, “how do you like
it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think I shall like it when I get used to it, sir,”
said Harry.</p>

<p>“I made a sale amounting to nearly eighteen
thousand dollars this morning,” remarked the commission
merchant.</p>

<p>“You’re not used to doing business on so large a
scale in the country, I take it?” said Brandon.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“The city’s the place for a smart lad like you.
You’ll make your way here.”</p>

<p>“I hope so.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it, if you attend to business, and do
whatever you are told.”</p>

<p>“I mean to do my duty.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk,” said Fairchild, who for a
wealthy city merchant used a variety of phrases
hardly to be expected. “By the time you’re thirty
you’ll be a rich man. I didn’t start with one quarter
of your advantages. When I was your age I worked
for three dollars a week, and had to pay my board
out of it. See where I am now.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fairchild, as I have stated, was dressed rather
shabbily, and, so far as appearance went, did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
seem to have got far beyond the point where he
started.</p>

<p>If Harry had not witnessed the extensive scale on
which he transacted business, he might not have been
very much impressed by his remarks; but, not suspecting
any deception, he supposed that everything
was as stated, and felt very much encouraged by his
remarks.</p>

<p>“You’ll be taking our young friend as partner
some of these days, Mr. Fairchild,” said Brandon.</p>

<p>“I make no promises,” answered Fairchild; “but
by the time he gets grown up I shall feel the need of
sharing my responsibilities with some one. If he
suits me, it may be as you say.”</p>

<p>“Why not? I suppose you are growing rich fast,
Fairchild.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t for me to say. I don’t tell all about
my affairs, as some do; but I could afford to give
away a hundred thousand dollars, and have enough
left to live handsomely.”</p>

<p>“I congratulate you on your success, and hope our
young friend here will succeed as well. By the way,
I wish you would order me some coffee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Certainly. Call for anything you like. Raymond,
will you have some coffee?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir, I should like some.”</p>

<p>“We poor sailors,” said Brandon, stirring his
coffee, “don’t get rich so fast as you merchants.
We brave the elements, and you reap the profits.
That’s about the way of it, I take it.”</p>

<p>“By the way, when do you sail, Captain Brandon?”</p>

<p>“It is not quite decided. In a day or two. Were
you ever on board a ship, my lad?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“You’d like to see one, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said our young hero, eagerly; “I should
enjoy it very much.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you could spare him a little
while to-morrow morning, Fairchild? Business isn’t
very driving, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I could spare him, I think, if he would like
to go.”</p>

<p>“All right, then. I shall be passing your office in
the morning, and will take him along and show him
the Sea Eagle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are very kind, sir,” said Harry, gratefully.</p>

<p>He was rather surprised at the amount of attention
he received from his employer and the captain. Indeed,
he had reason to be, for I may remark for the
benefit of my country readers, whose expectations
might otherwise be unduly raised, that city merchants
rarely offer a prospective partnership to a boy
on the first day of his entering their employment.
Had Harry possessed more experience, he might have
been led to suspect that there was something queer
about it; but he reflected that in the city things were
different from what he had been accustomed to in the
country. Even Mr. Porter, who only kept a common
village store, had not said anything about taking him
into partnership at any period, however remote; but
here was a wealthy city merchant who held out the
tempting inducement. No wonder our hero indulged
in some gorgeous castle-building, and began to dream
of what he would do when he was junior partner in
the city firm of Fairchild and Raymond.</p>

<p>At length the dinner was over, and the three
walked back in company to the office in Nassau
Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“What shall I do, Mr. Fairchild?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“You may keep on with your copying,” said his
employer, carelessly. “I have some business with
Captain Brandon, and shall be away with him most
of the afternoon. Yon can attend to the office.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“If any parties should call on business with me,
you may tell them to call to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“If a gentleman should call, and inquire my price
for a consignment of spices, you may say that the
lowest figure is ten thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“If he should be willing to pay that, you have my
authority to close the bargain.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Fairchild went out, and Harry was left
to himself. When he reflected that he was authorized
to close a bargain of so extensive a character, involving
property to the amount of ten thousand dollars,
he felt considerably raised in his own estimation.</p>

<p>“I might have plodded on in Vernon for fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
years, before having such a responsibility thrown
upon me,” he said to himself.</p>

<p>He continued his copying for an hour, when the
door opened, and a man entered briskly.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Fairchild in?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“When will he be in?”</p>

<p>“He may return late in the afternoon. He left
word, if any one called, to ask them to come back to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>“That won’t do for me. I must leave the city this
evening. I am sorry not to find him in,” said the
stranger, in a tone of vexation.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will leave word about your business,
and he can write to you.”</p>

<p>“It was about some spices that I wished to purchase,
if we could come to terms.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Harry, with animation, “he left word
with me about that. I can tell you whatever you
wish to know.”</p>

<p>“Do you know his price,—his lowest price?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; it is ten thousand dollars. He won’t
take a cent less.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are sure of that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he told me so expressly.”</p>

<p>“If he were here I would close the bargain.”</p>

<p>“You can do so now. I have authority to sell,”
said our hero, in a tone of pardonable importance.</p>

<p>“Indeed! You are quite a man of business of
your age. However, if you have authority for selling,
you may make out a bill, and I will send round my
check.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p>Harry did as requested, and the stranger, expressing
himself satisfied, departed.</p>

<p>Previous to Mr. Fairchild’s departure, he gave
Harry permission to write home if he desired it.
Our hero decided to avail himself of this permission,
being anxious to apprize his mother of his position,
and the circumstances in which he found himself.
Writing immediately after the important business
transaction just mentioned, he may be pardoned if
his letter is somewhat sanguine, and confident in its
tone.</p>

<p>This is what he wrote:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>:—It is so short a time since I
left home that you may suppose I will have nothing
to write; but I find things very different in the city
from what they are in Vernon. You will be surprised
when I tell you that I have just sold a lot of
spices for ten thousand dollars. Mr. Fairchild was
out, and told me what price to ask. We don’t keep
the goods we sell here. I don’t know where they
are kept yet; but I shall learn more about the business
when I have been here longer. The commission
which Mr. Fairchild gets on the sale I made amounts
to two hundred dollars; so I think I have earned my
wages so far, don’t you?</p>

<p>“I think I shall like Mr. Fairchild. He seems
disposed to be kind to me, and has said something
about taking me into partnership some time, if I suit
him. I shall try hard to do so, as that would bring
me a very large income, and I could do a great deal
for you, dear mother, and little Katy. If you should
see our place of business, you would be surprised
that so large a business could be done here. It is
only a small room, and not very pleasant. I felt
disappointed at first, but I begin to understand better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
now how they manage in the city. I was disappointed
in Mr. Fairchild, also. He does not seem
to care much about dress, considering how rich he is,
and what a splendid business he does. He has
introduced me to a sea-captain of his acquaintance,
who has invited me to go on board his vessel to-morrow.
I shall like it, as I never was on a ship.
Most of my time is spent in copying from a ledger.
I don’t know yet where I am to board; Mr. Fairchild
has not told me, but I will try to write you again to-morrow,
and let you know all about it. I wish you
were living here in the city, so that I could board
with you. That will come some time, I hope. I
close with much love to you and Katy.</p>

<p class="center">“Your affectionate son,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Harry Raymond.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>This letter gave great comfort to Mrs. Raymond.
She felt that, though Harry was separated from her
at present, he had embarked upon a prosperous business
career, and that better times were in store for
both. Poor woman! it was the last letter she
received from Harry for many a long, tedious day.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FIRST NIGHT IN THE CITY.</span></h2>

<p>Probably the reader has noticed, with some surprise,
that Mr. Fairchild addressed his sailor confederate
as <em>Captain</em> Brandon, and may have thought
the name wrongly applied. But by a lucky accident,
as he termed it, he had been unexpectedly elevated
to the chief command of the vessel on which he was
about to sail. Captain Hatch, who had been
expected to fill this place, was a good sailor, but
addicted to intemperate habits. In a fit of intoxication
only two days previous, he had got into a
fracas, and been so severely injured that it was found
necessary to send him to the hospital, where he was
likely to be detained some time. Meantime the Sea
Eagle was all ready to sail, and the owners, without
knowing much of Hartley Brandon, who had been
engaged as first mate, offered him the captain’s place,
which it is needless to say he accepted with alacrity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
It was a position which for years he had striven to
obtain, but until now unsuccessfully. So far as seamanship
was concerned, he was as well fitted for the
place as many who had filled it for years; but he was
reckless and unreliable, and disposed at times to be
despotic, so that he had never been popular with the
crews which he had commanded as officer. However,
there was little to choose, and to this fact he
was indebted for his present post.</p>

<p>Lemuel Fairchild was a seedy adventurer, whom he
had engaged for a small consideration to play the
part of a commission merchant, in order to draw
Harry to the city, where there would be an opportunity
to carry out his, or rather Squire Turner’s,
intentions, with regard to him. Of course, all the
large business transactions were bogus, the parties
pretending to purchase cargoes being intimates of
Fairchild. The office in Nassau Street had been
hired for a week only, as that would be sufficient for
Brandon’s purpose. The ledger, out of which our
hero was employed to copy, had formerly belonged
to a business house now bankrupt, and had been
bought cheap of a paper firm in Ann Street, whither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
it had found its way among the waste which is diligently
gathered by the squalid army of rag-pickers,
that usually prowl about the streets, and explore the
lanes and alleys of the great metropolis.</p>

<p>The reader is now in possession of all the net-work
of deception by which Brandon’s ingenuity had contrived
to dupe our young hero. It is no wonder that,
smart as he was, he failed to discover this. Whatever
seemed strange to him he naturally attributed
to his want of knowledge of city ways.</p>

<p>When night came, and the office closed, Mr. Fairchild
took Harry to Lovejoy’s once more to take supper.</p>

<p>“I must get a boarding-place for you to-morrow,”
he said. “To-night, I will secure a room for you
here.”</p>

<p>“Where do you live, Mr. Fairchild?” asked Harry,
with natural curiosity.</p>

<p>“Why, the fact is, I am boarding at the hotel
myself just at present. I have a fine house up town,
but it is being painted and refurnished, and, until
that is finished, I board at a hotel.”</p>

<p>“Are you married?” continued Harry, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
something of a Yankee, as he showed by his questions.</p>

<p>“My wife and children are travelling in Europe,”
said Mr. Fairchild, telling, of course, an unblushing
falsehood. “I would join them if I could get away
from my business. I must wait till I have a partner
to leave in charge.” And he looked at Harry in a
significant way, which caused our young hero’s heart
to beat with proud anticipations.</p>

<p>They made a very good supper, and then sat down
for a while in the public room, Fairchild smoking a
couple of cigars with evident enjoyment. He offered
one to Harry, which the latter declined, having fortunately
never acquired a habit that to boys, at least,
can never be productive of good.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock Harry asked permission to go
to bed. His long ride in the morning, with the new
experiences of his first day in the city, had produced
a feeling of fatigue.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you can go to bed if you like,” said Fairchild.
“I’ll speak to the clerk to give us a room
with two beds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“How early do you want me to get up in the
morning, Mr. Fairchild?”</p>

<p>“How early do you get up in the country?”</p>

<p>“About half-past five.”</p>

<p>“We don’t rise so early in the city. We’ll breakfast
at eight, and get to the office at nine. Any time
before eight will do.”</p>

<p>Harry thought that nine was rather late to commence
business; but this, as he supposed, was only
another difference between the city and the country.</p>

<p>Harry soon fell asleep in spite of the rattling of
wheels and the never-ceasing noise in the busy
street beneath. He was too tired even to dream, but
slept soundly until the next morning.</p>

<p>When he awoke it was broad daylight. He looked
across the room, and saw Fairchild still sleeping.
He jumped out of bed, and dressed hastily. Remembering
that it was his first morning in the city, he
was eager to go downstairs, and look about him.</p>

<p>Fairchild opened his eyes sleepily, as he completed
dressing.</p>

<p>“Up already, Raymond?” he asked, in a drowsy
tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“What time is it?”</p>

<p>“I just heard it strike seven.”</p>

<p>“Well, go down if you like. I will be down by
eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>Harry availed himself of the permission, and
descended four flights of stairs, for they were on the
fifth story, to the office.</p>

<p>As he emerged into the street, a ragged urchin
came up and accosted him with the familiar question,
“Shine yer boots?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Harry, perceiving that his boots
were stained with mud.</p>

<p>The task was performed in a creditable style, and
our hero was called upon to disburse ten cents. He
resolved, as soon as he got settled in a boarding-house,
to buy a brush and some blacking for himself,
feeling that he was not yet in circumstances to pay
ten cents daily for having his boots blacked.</p>

<p>He stood at the door of the hotel, and watched
the throng of wayfarers, which, commencing two
hours before, would flow without interruption through
the busy street until the small hours. It was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
our hero, born and bred in the quiet country, an
animated and interesting spectacle, and he felt glad,
in spite of a certain feeling of loneliness, that he
was employed in the city.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock his employer came down, and
they went together into the saloon, where they
took a substantial breakfast, the expense being
defrayed by Captain Brandon, acting for Squire
Turner.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards they went round to the office
in Nassau Street.</p>

<p>Lemuel Fairchild seated himself in his position
of the day before, with his heels on the mantel-piece,
and diligently perused the columns of the “New
York Herald,” a copy of which he had bought in the
street below.</p>

<p>“What shall I do, Mr. Fairchild?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Go on with your copying,” said Fairchild, not
lifting his eyes from the paper.</p>

<p>So our hero opened the ledger, and went to work.
His task was not a very interesting one. Still he
was earning two dollars a day, and this money
would enable him to provide for his mother; so he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
buckled to it in earnest, determined to show his
employer that he was not afraid of work. He had
commenced working for the partnership of which
a prospect had been given him.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock the door opened, and Brandon
entered.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Captain Brandon,” said Fairchild,
rising.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Fairchild. Good-morning, my
lad.”</p>

<p>“Good-morning, sir,” answered Harry.</p>

<p>“Well, my lad, are you ready to make a little
visit to my ship?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, if Mr. Fairchild is willing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll be willing; I’ll guarantee that. Your
writing can wait till another time. Eh, Fairchild?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he can go,” assented the merchant.</p>

<p>Harry picked up his hat, and accompanied Brandon
to the street.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said Brandon, in a whisper,
placing a small roll of bills in the hand of
Fairchild. “It’ll be a long time before you set eyes
on your office-boy again.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">GOING ON BOARD.</span></h2>

<p>Harry crossed Broadway with his companion,
and went down a side street to the North River pier,
at which lay the Sea Eagle, of which Brandon had
obtained the command. It was a vessel of good
size, and was now all ready for sea. This fact,
however, Captain Brandon did not care to communicate
to his young companion.</p>

<p>“How soon do you sail, Captain Brandon?” asked
Harry.</p>

<p>“In a day or two,” said Brandon.</p>

<p>“Is your voyage a long one?”</p>

<p>“We are bound for China.”</p>

<p>“That is a long trip.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a very long one.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you get tired of the sea?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we sailors get used to it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I should like it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“So you wouldn’t like being a sailor?” said
Brandon, looking at the lad with a meaning which
the latter did not understand.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think I should.”</p>

<p>“So I thought at your age; but I became a sailor,
after all.”</p>

<p>However it might have been in the case of Captain
Brandon, Harry thought it very improbable that
such a change would take place in his own views.</p>

<p>At length he reached the pier. Bales of merchandise
lay scattered about, and there was a general
appearance of confusion and disorder.</p>

<p>“There is my vessel,” said Captain Brandon,
pointing it out. “Don’t you want to go to China
with me?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Harry, with a smile, “but I
will wait till I am older.”</p>

<p>“And then go as a merchant, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will go on board, at all events. I will
show you about.”</p>

<p>Harry ascended to the deck, and Captain Brandon
followed. The latter began to point out and name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
various parts of the vessel, walking about with our
hero. The sailors looked with some curiosity at
Harry, but of course asked no questions. The mate,
however, Mr. Hawkes, after speaking with Brandon
about some matter connected with the vessel, asked,
“Is that the cabin-boy?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Brandon.</p>

<p>“He asks if you are the cabin-boy,” he said,
after the mate had passed on. “It’s a good joke,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Harry, smiling.</p>

<p>“Now suppose we go into the cabin,” said
Brandon.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” assented Harry.</p>

<p>Accordingly they descended into the ship’s cabin,
which, though small, was very comfortable.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Raymond,” said the captain, setting
the example.</p>

<p>On the cabin table was spread out a slight repast,
consisting of sandwiches and ale.</p>

<p>“We’ll take a little lunch,” said Brandon. “It’s
hungry work walking about the streets. You can
eat a little something, I guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Harry, accepting a sandwich.</p>

<p>“Let me pour you out some ale.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I care for any, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Pooh, nonsense, ale won’t do you any harm;”
and Brandon filled his glass.</p>

<p>Harry had never even tasted of ale, but he did not
know how to refuse the captain’s hospitality, and
raised the glass to his lips. The taste was not altogether
agreeable, so he merely sipped a little, and
set it down again.</p>

<p>“Don’t you like it?”</p>

<p>“Not very much.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, it’ll do you good. Nothing more
wholesome.”</p>

<p>“How long will your voyage be, Captain Brandon?”</p>

<p>“Eighteen months; perhaps longer. By the time
I get back, I suppose you will have become quite
a man of business.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“How do you like my friend Fairchild?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“He has been quite kind to me. I think I shall
like him.”</p>

<p>“Keep on, and some time you may be as rich as
he,” said the captain, closing the remark with a
laugh, for which our hero could see no good reason.</p>

<p>“I should like to be rich, for my mother’s sake,”
said Harry, seriously.</p>

<p>“For your mother’s sake, of course. Let me see,—what’s
the name of the town you come from?”</p>

<p>“Vernon.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I think I’ve heard of it. A small place,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it’s only a village.”</p>

<p>“Any rich people there?”</p>

<p>“There’s one,—Squire Turner.”</p>

<p>“Squire Turner?” repeated Brandon. “What
sort of a man is he?”</p>

<p>He asked the question carelessly, but fixed his
eyes on Harry as he spoke. It will be remembered
that Squire Turner, unwilling to trust his scapegrace
cousin too far, had carefully kept hidden from him
the cause of his hostility to our hero. This
naturally stimulated the curiosity of Brandon, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
whom it occurred that he might, by questioning the
boy, draw out the truth.</p>

<p>“He’s quite a prominent man in Vernon,” answered
Harry, cautiously.</p>

<p>“I suppose he is popular, also.”</p>

<p>“Not very popular.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“He is not very liberal.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t like him?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t had much to do with him.”</p>

<p>“Confound him! why don’t he speak out?” said
Brandon to himself. It occurred to him, however,
that further questions, respecting a man whom he
was not supposed to know, might excite the suspicions
of the boy, and he refrained.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Harry, who had a healthy boy’s appetite,
had commenced eating his second sandwich,
but he had not again tasted of the ale.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Captain Brandon, “suppose we
drink success to the Sea Eagle, and a quick and
prosperous voyage.”</p>

<p>So saying, he placed the glass to his lips.</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” responded Harry, following his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
example. He merely tasted the ale, however, and
then set down the glass.</p>

<p>“That will never do, my lad,” said the captain.
“It is always usual, on such occasions, to drain the
glass.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like ale very well.”</p>

<p>“But you won’t refuse to drink it, under such
circumstances?”</p>

<p>Fearing that his refusal might be misconstrued,
Harry gulped down the liquid, though with some difficulty.</p>

<p>“Come, that’s well,” said the captain, with satisfaction.
“I won’t ask you to drink any more. Now
suppose I tell you a little of the countries I have
visited. We sailors see strange things.”</p>

<p>“I should be glad to have you,” said our hero,
thinking that the captain took great pains to please
him.</p>

<p>Brandon launched out into a long and circumstantial
account of Brazil, and afterwards of Australia,
both of which he had visited. Harry listened
at first with interest, but gradually a strange sensation
of drowsiness came over him. His eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
drooped heavily, and it was with a continual effort
that he kept them open. The captain lowered his
voice, and kept talking in a low, monotonous tone
that helped the effect of the sleeping potion which,
unobserved, he had mingled with the ale in Harry’s
glass.</p>

<p>“I feel sleepy,” said our hero, at length, after making
a desperate effort to keep awake. “It is strange,
so early in the day.”</p>

<p>“I observed you found it hard to keep awake. I
suppose it is the noise and bustle of the city, to which
you are not accustomed. I’ll tell you what, my lad,
I’ve got a little business to attend to on deck. As I
shan’t go back to Nassau Street for an hour or two
I’ll give you that time for a nap.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Harry, drowsily. “Won’t
Mr. Fairchild think it strange, my being away so
long?”</p>

<p>“I’ll make it all right with him. He’s very good-natured.
So just lie down, and have your nap out.”</p>

<p>Harry lay down, and in two minutes his senses
were locked in profound repose. Captain Brandon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
looked at him with satisfaction as he lay stretched
out before him.</p>

<p>“It was a lucky thought of mine, the sleeping
potion,” he said to himself. “He’s polite enough,
but there’s plenty of will and determination about
him. I can see that by the cut of his lip. He might
have made me considerable trouble. Now, he’s safe
to sleep eighteen hours at least, unless the druggist
deceived me.”</p>

<p>He went on deck, taking care, however, to lock the
cabin door behind him. On the deck he met Mr.
Hawkes, the mate.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Hawkes,” he said, “what is the
prospect?”</p>

<p>“I think we shall get off in an hour, Captain
Brandon.”</p>

<p>“Good.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t quite understand about the lad you had
with you. Does he sail with us?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“As cabin-boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he doesn’t know it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see,” said Hawkes, nodding intelligently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“His friends have thought it best to send him to
sea, but he is obstinate and headstrong, and might
make trouble; so I agreed to manage it.”</p>

<p>He briefly related the strategy of which he had
made use. The mate laughed approvingly.</p>

<p>“We’ll make a sailor of him before we get
through,” he said.</p>

<p>“No doubt of it.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile our hero, wrapped in a sleep unnaturally
profound, slumbered on happily unconscious
of the unjustifiable plot which had been contrived
against him. On deck all was bustle and hurry.
The pilot was all ready on board, the sailors were
hurrying about in obedience to the quick commands
of the officers, the creaking of cordage was heard,
and in a short time the Sea Eagle had commenced
her voyage. But Harry heard nothing. His slumber
was profound. His career as an office-boy was at
an end, and after one brief day in the great city he
was drifting away unconsciously from home and
friends, in the power of a reckless man, from whose
despotism there was no appeal.</p>

<p>I am quite sure that my young readers will all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
sympathize with Harry. His misfortune was in no
sense occasioned by his misconduct. He had left
home with a firm determination to do his duty, and
work his way upward to a position where he could be
of service to his mother and sister; but all his plans
seemed disastrously interrupted.</p>

<p>But I do not despair of Harry yet. Hitherto his
course has been smooth, and he has had no opportunity
of showing what he is. Difficulties develop
strength of character, and it is pretty clear that
Harry has got into difficulties, and those of a serious
kind.</p>

<p>Will he sink or swim?</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">HARRY REALIZES HIS POSITION.</span></h2>

<p>For eighteen hours that long, unnatural sleep held
our hero in its benumbing grasp. For eighteen
hours he lay utterly unconscious of what was passing
around. But at the end of that time sleep loosened
its hold upon him. He opened his eyes and looked
bewildered. He was almost instantly made aware
that the vessel was in motion. On standing up he
found himself staggering from one side of the cabin
to the other, for a brisk wind had sprung up, causing
considerable motion to the ship.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” exclaimed Harry, in dismay,
“the vessel has started. What will Mr. Fairchild
say? He will think I have run away.”</p>

<p>He blamed himself very much for having fallen
asleep, but, not yet suspecting bad faith on the captain’s
part, could not understand why he had not
been waked up in time to go on shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>He hurried to the cabin door, and tried to open it,
but in vain. It was securely locked.</p>

<p>“What can it mean?” thought our hero, in utter
bewilderment.</p>

<p>He shook the door, and called out at the top of his
voice:—</p>

<p>“Captain Brandon, let me out!”</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Harry continued calling for five minutes, shaking
the door meanwhile. At last, indignant, and for the
first time suspecting that something was wrong, he
began to kick against the panels violently, calling
out:—</p>

<p>“Captain Brandon!”</p>

<p>This time he received attention. Steps were heard
outside, a key was put in the lock, and the captain
made his appearance.</p>

<p>“What are you kicking up such a row about?”
he demanded, harshly.</p>

<p>“Has the vessel sailed?” asked Harry, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, it has.”</p>

<p>“But I am not to go. Can’t you send me on
shore?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain answered this appeal, with a horse-laugh.</p>

<p>“Look here, youngster, how far do you think we
are from New York?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell you. We have sailed so far about
a hundred and fifty miles.”</p>

<p>“A hundred and fifty miles!” ejaculated our hero,
his breath almost taken away at the magnitude of this
disaster.</p>

<p>“Yes, a little more than that possibly. Perhaps
you’d like to have me send you back in a small
boat?”</p>

<p>“How long have I been asleep?” asked Harry,
finding the captain’s statement almost incredible.</p>

<p>“You went to sleep yesterday about noon, and
now it’s the next morning.”</p>

<p>“Is this true?”</p>

<p>“Do you dare to question the truth of anything I
say, you impudent young rascal?” said the captain,
fiercely.</p>

<p>Harry had not got over his bewilderment. He
understood how he was situated, and that his misfortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
was due to the captain’s neglect to wake
him up.</p>

<p>“Captain Brandon,” he said, calmly, “you promised
to wake me up, and send me on shore. Why
didn’t you do it?”</p>

<p>“Do you think I’m going to be catechised by such
a young lubber as you?” demanded Captain Brandon,
with an oath.</p>

<p>“You’ve served me a mean trick,” said Harry
indignantly, facing the captain with his youthful
form drawn up, and his face flushed with anger.</p>

<p>“Young man, do you know where you are?” said
the captain, sternly.</p>

<p>“I am where I ought not to be. In the cabin of
the Sea Eagle.”</p>

<p>“And do you know who I am?”</p>

<p>“You are the captain.”</p>

<p>“You are right there. I command this vessel, and
all on board, and I won’t tolerate any mutiny;” qualifying
the last word with an oath.</p>

<p>“You have no authority over me, Captain Brandon,”
said Harry, proudly. “You have entrapped
me on board this vessel. I am not here of my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
free will, and you have no more authority over me
than you have over the president of the United
States.”</p>

<p>“You think I haven’t, eh?”</p>

<p>“I know you have not,” said our hero, firmly.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll find yourself mistaken, my lad; that’s
all about it.”</p>

<p>“As long as I am obliged to remain on board, I
am a passenger, and claim to be treated as such.”</p>

<p>“Then suppose you pay your fare,” said Captain
Brandon, with a malicious smile.</p>

<p>“I can’t do it, and I don’t feel bound to, for I
didn’t want to come.”</p>

<p>“You’re mighty independent,” sneered the captain;
“and I have no doubt it will suit you excellently
to get your board and passage for nothing.
But I may have something to say to that.”</p>

<p>“What will Mr. Fairchild say when I don’t come
back?” said Harry, in a troubled voice, rather to
himself than with the expectation of an answer.</p>

<p>Captain Brandon laughed.</p>

<p>“He’ll think you have run away.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose he will,” said Harry, disturbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course he will.”</p>

<p>“And what will my mother think?” resumed
Harry, sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’ll think you’ve been led away, and got
into some scrape or other,” said the captain, lightly.
“However, she’ll see you again in eighteen months,
that is, if we have a fair voyage.”</p>

<p>“Eighteen months!” repeated our hero, in dismay.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a long ways to China. You’ll be quite a
sailor by the end of that time.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to be a sailor,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Don’t say that again, you impudent young scoundrel.
Do you think I will let my cabin-boy address
me in that style?”</p>

<p>“I am not your cabin-boy,” said Harry, indignantly.</p>

<p>“That’s your mistake. You’ve got to work your
passage. I shan’t allow any skulkers aboard this
ship.”</p>

<p>This speech, as well as most of the captain’s, was
garnished with oaths, which I choose to omit, though
at the risk of conveying an inadequate idea of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
brutality and coarseness. Our hero was greatly exasperated
at the mean plot which had been concocted
against him, and being of a fearless temperament
would have given full and free expression to his
indignation, and a scene of violence would no doubt
have resulted, but for the opportune entrance of Mr.
Weldon, the supercargo.</p>

<p>Mr. Weldon was a young man, not over twenty-five,
a nephew of the owner of the vessel, and had
been sent out as supercargo, with the intention of
remaining in China for two or three years in a branch
establishment of his uncle’s house. On account of
his connection with the firm by whom he was employed,
Captain Brandon found it prudent to treat
him with more respect than in ordinary circumstances
he would have paid to the supercargo.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Captain Brandon,” said the
young man.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr. Weldon,” said Brandon,
smoothing his face, and lowering his arm, which had
been raised to strike Harry. “How do you feel this
morning?”</p>

<p>“Not sea-sick as yet; but I don’t know how soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
it may be on. I am in no hurry for it, I can assure
you. But who is this young gentleman?”</p>

<p>“You are joking, Mr. Weldon,” said the captain.
“We don’t usually address cabin-boys as young gentlemen
on board ship.”</p>

<p>“Is he your cabin-boy?” asked Weldon, in surprise;
for Harry was not, it will be remembered,
dressed in sailor rig.</p>

<p>“No, I am not,” said Harry, boldly.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” said the captain, sharply, with a
threatening look. “He’s a headstrong young rascal,
whom his friends have placed in my charge, with
intentions to make a sailor of him.”</p>

<p>“That is not true. I was trapped on board this
vessel,” said our hero.</p>

<p>“I used a little stratagem, knowing that I would
have trouble otherwise,” said the captain, who would
not have deigned any explanation to any other than
the nephew of his employer, in whose estimation he
wished to stand well. “But now he’s on board, I
shall carry out the wishes of his friends, and he will
find it for his interest not to make any trouble,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
added, with a significant look directed towards our
hero.</p>

<p>At this moment the captain was summoned to the
deck, and Harry found himself alone with the supercargo.</p>

<p>“Mr. Weldon,” said our hero, suddenly, making
up his mind to secure the young man as a friend if
possible, “do you go with us to China?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my boy.”</p>

<p>“Will you be my friend?”</p>

<p>Such an appeal, coming from a frank, manly boy,
was not easily to be resisted.</p>

<p>Mr. Weldon took the hand so frankly offered, and
said:—</p>

<p>“I will be your friend. I believe you are a good
boy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe what Captain Brandon has told
you. It is absolutely false. I never saw or heard
of him till two days since, and he does not know any
of my friends. He induced me to come on board
this ship on false pretences, and I think must have
given me something to make me sleep, for I became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
sleepy at once, and have slept, as he tells me, ever
since yesterday noon.”</p>

<p>“This is a strange story. What can be his
object?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that; but he has got me into his
power, and I need a friend.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Harry Raymond.”</p>

<p>“Then, Harry,” said the young man, warmly
pressing his hand, “I will be that friend. If what
you say is true, you have been badly treated. I
think I have some influence over Captain Brandon,
for he is in the employ of my uncle’s firm. That
influence shall be exerted in your favor.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Weldon,” said Harry, gratefully.</p>

<p>“I wish you would tell me a little more about
yourself that I may understand your position fully
If the captain comes down, you can suspend your
story till another time.”</p>

<p>“First, I want to ask your advice on one point,”
said Harry.</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“The captain claims that I must work my passage
as cabin-boy. What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Have you a great objection to the duties of a
cabin-boy?”</p>

<p>“I would not have come on board the vessel of my
own free will. I don’t like to be forced into going in
such a position.”</p>

<p>“That is a natural feeling; but I am not sure
whether it will not be best to yield in the present
instance. A captain on board of his own vessel is a
monarch, and has almost supreme power. This is
very often abused; but I suppose it is necessary that
he should possess it. I don’t know what sort of a
man this Captain Brandon is; but you had better not
needlessly provoke him. Besides, I suppose you
wish to be earning something, and, as cabin-boy, you
will be entitled to wages.”</p>

<p>“Suppose the captain should ill-treat me?”</p>

<p>“I will stand your friend,” said the supercargo,
earnestly.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Harry, after a moment’s thought,
“I will not oppose the captain’s wishes. I will do
my duty, but I won’t submit to be imposed upon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The entrance of the captain at this point prevented
our hero from communicating the details of his story
to his new friend.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="smaller">HARRY GETS INTO TROUBLE.</span></h2>

<p>Captain Brandon entered the cabin, carrying
under his arm a cabin-boy’s suit.</p>

<p>“It’s time you entered upon your duties,” he said.
“Put on these clothes.”</p>

<p>He expected a renewal of Harry’s remonstrances;
but our hero had made up his mind what to do. It
was no use crying over spilt milk. Since he was on
board the Sea Eagle, however much against his will,
he would make the best of a disagreeable position.
He had confidence in the judgment and friendship of
the supercargo, whom he liked, notwithstanding their
brief acquaintance, and he resolved to accept the
situation, and do his best in it. When, therefore,
the captain held out the cabin-boy’s suit, Harry took
it quietly, asking:—</p>

<p>“Where shall I put it on?”</p>

<p>“You can put it on here,” said the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>,
looking at him curiously. Remembering the state
of fiery indignation which our hero displayed a few
minutes before, he was not prepared for this quiet
acquiescence.</p>

<p>“So you’ve changed your mind, have you?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“No, Captain Brandon,” answered Hurry, firmly.
“I have been treacherously entrapped on board this
vessel, and I remain here against my will; but as
long as I stay I may as well have something to do.
I will act as cabin-boy, and shall expect to receive a
cabin-boy’s wages.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you’ve turned sensible,” said
Brandon. “It would have been the worse for you if
you hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to deceive you as to my intentions,
Captain Brandon,” continued Harry, boldly.
“I mean to leave this ship the first chance I get.”</p>

<p>“That won’t be very soon,” sneered Brandon;
“as I don’t expect to stop anywhere till I reach
China. If you want to leave me there, I shan’t take
any great pains to catch you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time Harry had changed his clothes, and
had all the appearance of a young sailor.</p>

<p>“Now go and report yourself to the mate,” said
Captain Brandon.</p>

<p>Harry left the cabin, and went up on deck. He
saw and recognized the man to whom the captain had
spoken the day before, and walked up to him.</p>

<p>“I believe you are the mate, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, my lad, and who are you? The new cabin-boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. The captain ordered me to report to
you.”</p>

<p>“Tom Patch!” said the mate, calling one of the
sailors near by.</p>

<p>Tom Patch came forward, hitching up his pants, as
he advanced with a regular sailor’s roll. He had a
short, square-built figure, and a face bronzed by
exposure to the suns of every clime. But his expression
was honest and intelligent, not brutish and
stupid, as is the case with many who have followed
the sea for years without rising above the position of
a common sailor.</p>

<p>“Show him his bunk. Patch, and break him in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir,” said Patch, turning to Harry, whom
he surveyed with interest.</p>

<p>“Come with me, my lad,” he said.</p>

<p>They descended into the forecastle, where Harry
was assigned a bunk near that of the sailor under
whose care he had been placed.</p>

<p>“You’re a green hand, I reckon, my lad,” said
Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said our hero.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you’re going to sea. I don’t see
how folks can be contented to live on shore.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that?” asked Harry, rather
amused.</p>

<p>“Of course I do.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t agree with you. I’d rather be on
land.”</p>

<p>“Mayhap you’ve been sea-sick. You’ll get over it
soon, and then you’ll find it jolly.”</p>

<p>“No, I have not been sick; but I don’t like the
sea.”</p>

<p>“Then what brought you here?” said Tom, in
natural wonder.</p>

<p>“Captain Brandon. He served me a mean trick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“Avast there, my lad!” said Tom, lowering his
voice, and looking around him significantly. “It
aint best to talk ag’in the cap’n, leastways so he can
hear.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid,” said our hero, firmly. “I told
him so myself.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Tom, incredulously.</p>

<p>“I told Captain Brandon he had served me a mean
trick.”</p>

<p>“And he knocked you down with a belaying-pin?”
suggested Tom.</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t,” said Harry, quietly.</p>

<p>“Then you got off easy. Better not say it ag’in,
my lad.”</p>

<p>“It’s true.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that. It aint best to tell the truth
at all times. You shall spin me the yarn some time
when we are snugly stowed away out of earshot,
my lad. Now we must go to work.”</p>

<p>Harry accompanied Tom to the deck, and his
experience as a sailor commenced.</p>

<p>I do not propose to give a detailed account of
what these duties were, as this does not profess to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
be a sea-story, and will touch the sea only so far as
it may prove necessary to make Harry’s position
understood. Days passed away, and in accordance
with the resolution he had formed our hero attended
strictly to duty. Being a smart boy, he very soon
mastered the details of his duties, and discharged
them in such a manner that no fault could justly be
found with him. But Captain Brandon continued
to view him with an eye of suspicion. He had not
forgotten nor forgiven the bold and defiant manner
in which Harry had expressed himself when he first
realized that he had been entrapped on board the
Sea Eagle. He blamed himself now that he had
not inflicted a humiliating punishment upon Harry
at the time, and he carefully scrutinized his conduct
in order to find a pretext for paying off the old
score.</p>

<p>But Harry thus far gave him no opportunity. He
had not made any complaints against the captain to
any one except Tom Patch, to whom he told his
whole story, winning the stout-hearted sailor’s sympathy
and friendship. Thus Harry felt that he had
one friend on the vessel; nay, two, for the supercargo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of whom mention has already been made,
had by no means forgotten the promise he made to
our hero to be his friend. He frequently approached
him when at work, and conversed with him in a
pleasant manner, as with an equal, never putting on
an air of condescension, as some in his position
would have done.</p>

<p>This intimacy and evident good feeling between
the supercargo and our hero, Captain Brandon saw
with dissatisfaction. He had tried to cultivate an
intimacy with Mr. Weldon himself, from motives
of policy, on account of his relationship to the
owner of the ship, and the probability that he
would some day be himself a member of the firm;
but it had not taken the supercargo long to ascertain
the real character of the captain, in which he found
very little to attract him. So, though he treated
Captain Brandon with scrupulous civility, there was
a coolness in his manner which effectually precluded
any degree of intimacy. The captain saw this and
chafed at it. It humiliated him, yet he could not
resent it. The young man was studiously polite
and respectful, and gave him no cause for complaint.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
But he saw that his ceremonious politeness melted
away when he spoke to Harry Raymond whom he
addressed in a cordial, kindly manner which bespoke
friendship. Captain Brandon brooded over this,
being of a jealous, suspicious temper, and resolved,
on the first occasion that presented itself, to take
vengeance upon Harry, and thus at once gratify his
dislike for our hero and the supercargo.</p>

<p>There was another member of the ship’s crew
whom it will be necessary to introduce.</p>

<p>This was Jack Rodman, a boy somewhat older
than Harry, and as different from our hero as can
well be imagined. He was coarse, ignorant, and
vicious, and could swear with as great fluency as
any sailor twice his age. He made at first some
approaches to intimacy with our hero, but Harry
was too disgusted with what he had seen of him
to care much about striking up a friendship. On
this account Jack bore a grudge against our hero,
and would have played some mischievous trick upon
him but for Tom Patch’s evident friendship for
Harry. Jack was afraid of the stout sailor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
felt compelled to effect his object in an underhand
manner.</p>

<p>Among the peculiarities of Captain Brandon’s
appearance was a very long nose, which, however
useful it might be to the owner, was far from
ornamental. Brandon was aware of the prominence
of this feature, and felt sensitive about it.
As a boy he had been annoyed by the jocose allusions
of his school-fellows to it, and nothing disturbed
his temper more now than any reference to
it, or even a significant glance at it. Jack Rodman
had observed this peculiarity in the captain, and
determined to take advantage of it in order to get
Harry into trouble.</p>

<p>One night, unobserved as he supposed, he drew
with a piece of chalk a rude caricature of the captain’s
face, in a part of the vessel where it would be
likely to be seen by Brandon. The size of the nose
was exaggerated, but there was also in the other
features a general resemblance to the captain, so
that it was quite evident who was meant.</p>

<p>Jack supposed that he was unobserved, and so he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
might have been but for the accidental approach of
the supercargo.</p>

<p>Mr. Weldon glanced at what Jack was doing, and
a smile came to his face. He was rather amused
by the caricature, and, having no very particular
regard for the captain, passed on in silence, not
feeling called upon to interfere.</p>

<p>The next morning Captain Brandon, in pacing
the deck, suddenly came face to face with the caricature,
which had not been effaced.</p>

<p>Instantly the blood rushed to his face. He could
see the resemblance himself; and that made the
matter worse. He felt that it was an insult to him,
and he determined to visit condign punishment upon
the perpetrator of the insulting joke, if he could find
him out.</p>

<p>“Who did this?” he roared out, at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p>The vehemence of his tone attracted general
attention. The sailors looked at one another, and
exchanged sly glances indicative of amusement.</p>

<p>“Who did this?” exclaimed the captain, again,
stamping in rage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Nobody answered.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you answer, some of you?” continued
the angry captain. “Point out the man, and
I’ll flog him till he can’t stand.”</p>

<p>Even this inducement was not sufficient to extract
the name of the culprit.</p>

<p>Captain Brandon resolved to use other means.</p>

<p>“I’ll give five dollars to the man who’ll tell me
who drew this figure.”</p>

<p>Jack Rodman came on deck just as this offer was
made. His eyes sparkled with joy. He not only
had it in his power to get Harry into trouble, but he
would be rewarded for doing it. This was more than
he had bargained for, but Jack reflected that the
money would be very acceptable to him when he
got on shore.</p>

<p>“I know who did it, Captain Brandon,” he said,
touching his hat.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the captain, turning towards Jack.
“Tell me at once, then.”</p>

<p>“<em>He</em> did it,” said Jack, pointing out Harry, who,
like the rest, was an interested spectator of the
scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did <em>he</em> do it?” growled Brandon, looking menacingly
at our hero.</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw him do it.”</p>

<p>“When did he do it?”</p>

<p>“Last evening.”</p>

<p>By the time Harry, who had been struck dumb
by the suddenness of the accusation, and the
evident malice of Jack, recovered himself, and said
boldly:—</p>

<p>“Captain Brandon, that is a lie, and Jack Rodman
knows it is. I know nothing of the figure,
and had nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p>“I saw you do it,” said Jack, with a malicious
grin.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt he did it,” said the captain,
furiously. “Strip him, and well give him a taste
of the lash.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="smaller">AN UNEXPECTED VICTORY.</span></h2>

<p>The captain’s order was a general one and
addressed to no one in particular. The sailors stood
still, therefore, till the captain exclaimed again,
stamping fiercely:—</p>

<p>“Seize him, I say, and strip him.”</p>

<p>With a grin of enjoyment Jack Rodman started
forward, and prepared to obey the captain’s command.
He expected to be supported by others of
the crew, but found himself alone. Still he was
taller and stouter than Harry, and felt confident of
an easy victory over him.</p>

<p>When our hero saw him approach, he said, in a
cool, collected manner, by no means intimidated by
the prospect of a conflict with his superior in size:—</p>

<p>“Stand off, Jack Rodman, if you know what’s
good for yourself!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“What can you do?” sneered Jack; and he gave
a glance at the captain for encouragement.</p>

<p>“Give him a thrashing!” said the captain, anticipating
with pleasure the utter discomfiture of Harry,
who, so far as appearances went, was decidedly the
weaker of the two. But appearances are sometimes
deceitful, and Jack Rodman would not have been by
any means so confident of an easy victory, had he
been aware that our hero, as previously stated, was
no mean proficient in the art of self-defence, having
been initiated in the science of boxing by a young
man from New York, who spent a summer in Vernon.</p>

<p>“A ring! a ring!” shouted the sailors. “Let ’em
have it out!”</p>

<p>No opposition being made by the officers, the crew
at once formed a ring round the two combatants. A
few of the more generous sympathized with the
“little one,” as they called Harry; but with the
majority there was no particular sentiment, except a
desire to see the fight, with no preference for either
party. Prominent in the ring was Tom Patch,
Harry’s friend. His honest, bronzed face was shadowed
by anxiety, for he, like the rest, had no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
that Harry would get whipped. He longed to have a
part in the fray, and take his side by his young
friend; but that, of course, could not be allowed.</p>

<p>“It’s a shame,” he muttered. “It aint a fair
match. Jack’s twenty pounds heavier than the little
one.”</p>

<p>“Let ’em fight it out! Who cares which gets
whipped?” said the next sailor.</p>

<p>“I do,” said Tom. “The little fellow’s a good
one, and I don’t believe he made the figger.”</p>

<p>“Silence, men!” exclaimed the captain, in an
authoritative voice. “Pitch into him, boy, and mind
you give him a sound flogging, or you’ll get one
yourself.”</p>

<p>Jack did not need to be urged on. He had an unreasoning
and unreasonable hatred to our hero, whom
he instinctively felt to be his superior in every way
but one, though he did not choose to acknowledge it,
that was in physical strength, in which he felt confident
that he excelled Harry. He accordingly advanced
in a blustering way, confident of an easy
victory, swinging his fists in an unscientific way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="600" height="380" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“<span class="smcap">Let ’em fight it out.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>Harry awaited his approach calmly, quietly putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
himself in the proper attitude of defence. With
his fists doubled up, prepared for action, and one foot
advanced before the other, he stood, watching warily
the demonstrations of his antagonist. Jack did not
comprehend the meaning of this preparation, and continued
to advance with rash confidence in his own
prowess. He made a fierce lunge at our hero, not taking
care to protect himself against assault. The consequence
was, that while Harry parried the blow with
one hand, with the other he planted a smart return
blow in Rodman’s face, which, striking his nose,
drew blood.</p>

<p>There was a shout of applause, mingled with surprise,
at this unexpected turning of the tables.</p>

<p>“Good for you!” “I bet on the little one!”
“He’s got pluck!” was heard from the sailors.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most astonished person on deck was
Jack Rodman himself. Evidently he had made some
mistake in his calculations. He had gone in for an
easy victory, and expected that his first blow would
prove a crusher. But, instead of this, his own nose
was bleeding, and his small antagonist stood facing
him, as cool and composed as if, instead of being an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
actor in the contest, he had only been an indifferent
spectator.</p>

<p>How did it all happen? That was what puzzled
Jack. He took a fresh look at Harry, to make sure
that he was right in his first impression, as to his
inferior size and strength.</p>

<p>“Give it to him, Jack! Don’t let him get the
best of you!” called out a backer.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t,” growled Jack. “I’ll chaw him
up.”</p>

<p>Our hero listened to this threat without being discomposed.
He had made a critical survey of his
antagonist, and formed an estimate of his ability.
He saw that Jack was his superior in strength, and
if they should come to a close contest that he would
get the worst of it. But he saw also that of scientific
fighting Jack knew nothing. His course was to keep
him at arm’s length, and conduct the contest on
scientific principles.</p>

<p>Jack rushed in again with the same headlong precipitation
as before, and his reception was about the
same as before. This time our hero planted a blow
in his left eye, which caused Jack to stagger back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
with a howl of dismay and rage. By this time his
blood was up, and he was driven on by a kind of
blind fury, aggravated by the mortification he experienced
at being worsted by a smaller boy in presence
of the ship’s crew. His reputation was at stake.
He knew that if he retired from the contest defeated,
he would never hear the last of it. A coward and a
bully by nature, he never would have made the first
attack, had he anticipated that Harry would prove
so powerful an antagonist; but now he was in for
it his blood was up, and he determined, as the boys
say, “to go in and win.”</p>

<p>He made another furious dash, and tried hard to
seize Harry around the middle, when he would have
found it an easy task, in consequence of his superior
strength, to throw him down, and take vengeance
upon him for the personal damages he had already
received. But our hero understood very well his
purpose, and braced himself for what he instinctively
felt would be the final contest. He eluded the grasp
of his furious adversary, and planted two blows quick
as lightning, one in his breast, the other in his face.
While Jack was staggering under them, he gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
up his strength, and put it all into one final blow,
which finished the work effectually. Jack fell on
deck heavily, and so bewildered was he that he lay
there motionless, and did not at first attempt to
rise.</p>

<p>This quite turned the tide in favor of our hero.
Sailors admire pluck, especially when it is shown by
a little fellow contending against odds. There was a
chorus of approving exclamations, expressed in the
characteristic sailor dialect, and Harry, standing in
the centre of the ring, his face flushed with the excitement
of the contest, was transformed in the eyes of
all into a hero. The most delighted of all was Tom
Patch, who swung his hat, and called out for three
cheers for the victor. The result was the more gratifying
to him, because wholly unexpected. The
supercargo, also, standing aloof from the ring, had
witnessed the contest, and his sympathies also had
been with our hero, for he had already formed an
opinion far from favorable of Jack Rodman, whom
he had another reason for not liking.</p>

<p>But there was one to whom the result of the contest
was in the highest degree unsatisfactory. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
was Captain Brandon. He had been far from anticipating
such a denouement, and a frown gathered
on his face.</p>

<p>“Get up, and try it again!” he said to Jack.</p>

<p>But Jack Rodman had had enough of it. The last
five minutes had enlightened him considerably on the
subject of Harry’s prowess, and he did not care to
trust himself again in his hands. Besides, his nose was
damaged, and his eye swollen, and he felt decidedly
worse for the exercise he had just taken. Accordingly
he intimated that he did not feel very well,
and positively refused to renew the fight.</p>

<p>“All right!” growled Captain Brandon. “I’ve got
an account to settle with the boy myself. He may
not get off so easily out of my hands. Men, go back
to your work.”</p>

<p>At the captain’s word of command the ring was
broken, and the sailors returned to the duties which
had been interrupted by the contest that has just
been described.</p>

<p>“Now, you young rascal,” said Captain Brandon,
menacingly, “what did you mean by that —— picture?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
filling up the blank with an oath, with which
I do not choose to soil this page.</p>

<p>“I have already told you, Captain Brandon,” said
Harry, firmly, “that I had nothing to do with the
drawing.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” said the captain, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“It’s the truth,” repeated Harry, glancing composedly
at the face of Captain Brandon, distorted
with rage.</p>

<p>“Do you dare to contradict me?” exclaimed the
captain, furiously.</p>

<p>“I contradict no one,” said Harry. “I only say
that I had nothing to do with that picture. I did
not see it till this morning, a short time before you
charged me with it.”</p>

<p>“Your lie shan’t save you!” exclaimed Captain
Brandon. “I’ll take you in hand myself, and we’ll
see who’ll come off best.”</p>

<p>Harry turned pale. He knew that he was no match
for a grown man, and he saw that in the present
state of the captain’s temper he was likely to suffer
severely. That he should dread the treatment he
was likely to receive was only natural, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
showed no outward fear, save in the paleness of his
cheeks. He stood manfully, with his lips compressed,
waiting for the attack. But help came to him from
an unexpected quarter.</p>

<p>“Stop one moment, Captain Brandon!” said the
supercargo, and there was a tone of authority in the
young man’s voice.</p>

<p>The captain turned.</p>

<p>“Mr. Weldon,” he said, “this is no affair of yours
I will thank you to attend to your own business.”</p>

<p>“Captain Brandon, you are about to punish this
boy for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Do you call that nothing?” asked the captain,
indicating the caricature.</p>

<p>“He had no hand in it.”</p>

<p>“So he says.”</p>

<p>“He tells the truth.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you can tell me who drew it, then?”
sneered the captain.</p>

<p>“I can.”</p>

<p>For one moment the captain thought that the
supercargo might himself have been implicated; but
he saw that this was absurd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who did it, then?”</p>

<p>“The boy he was fighting with,—Jack Rodman.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of this?” demanded the captain, in
amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes; I saw him myself engaged upon it last evening.
I would not have betrayed him, had he not
tried to implicate an innocent party.”</p>

<p>Captain Brandon knew not what to think. He could
not doubt the supercargo’s word after this positive
statement, nor could he proceed to punish Harry for
a fault which, as it appeared, he had not committed.
Yet, strange as it may appear, he felt more incensed
against Harry, who was proved to be innocent, than
against Jack Rodman, whom he knew to be guilty.
He could not help wishing that he had not been told
the truth of the matter until he had inflicted punishment
upon our hero.</p>

<p>In return for the supercargo’s explanation, he did
not reply a word, but, turning on his heel, descended
the companion-way to the cabin, where he kept himself
for the next two or three hours. After he had
left the deck, Harry went up to the supercargo, and
in a frank way said:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“I cannot tell you, Mr. Weldon, how much I am
obliged to you for coming to my defence.”</p>

<p>“I told you I would stand your friend when you
stood in need of one.” said the young man, kindly.
“I am thankful that I was able to do it so effectually.”</p>

<p>He took Harry’s hand and pressed it warmly. Our
young hero felt, with a thrill of thankfulness, that he
had at least one good friend on board the Sea Eagle;
two, in fact, for Tom Patch he knew would stand by
him through thick and thin.</p>

<span class="smaller">IN SUSPENSE.</span></h2>

<p>We must now go back to Vernon, and inquire how
Mrs. Raymond is getting on, while Harry is each day
drifting further and further away from home.</p>

<p>Harry’s first and only letter from the city has
already been given. It brought comfort and a
degree of hopefulness to his mother. She felt that
she could bear her solitude better if Harry was doing
well. A few years, and they might be together
again, as he anticipated; perhaps living in New
York. In the mean time, he must come home once
a month at least. Then his letters would, no doubt,
be frequent.</p>

<p>Two days passed, however, and no letter. She
began to get anxious, but reflected that Harry probably
had a great deal to do. Still it was not like him
to neglect her. He was too thoughtful and considerate
a boy for that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>Two days more passed, and still no letter. Mrs.
Raymond now become very anxious. She had about
made up her mind to go up to the city herself, though
she could ill spare the money needful for the trip,
when she met Squire Turner in the street, on the
way home from the post-office.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mrs. Raymond,” he said, graciously:
“what do you hear from Harry? I am told
he has gone to the city to seek his fortune.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond was glad to have some one to whom
she could impart her anxiety.</p>

<p>“I am feeling very anxious about him,” she said.
“I received a letter from Harry four days ago, just
after he reached New York, and I have heard nothing
since.”</p>

<p>“No doubt he is very busy,” said the squire.</p>

<p>“He would not be too busy to write me a few lines.
He would know that I should feel anxious,” said
Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>“Don’t feel troubled, Mrs. Raymond. I know
how it is with boys. They dislike writing letters.
It was the way with me when I was a boy.”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“It isn’t the way with Harry,” she said. “He
knows too well how lonely I am without him, and
how much I depend upon hearing from him.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has written, and the letter has miscarried.
Letters often do. I have it happen frequently.”</p>

<p>“It may be,” said Mrs. Raymond, with momentary
relief. “I wish I was sure of it. He is my only
boy, Squire Turner. If anything should happen to
him, it would break my heart.”</p>

<p>Knowing full well the wicked plot he had contrived
against this poor woman’s peace and happiness,
Squire Turner felt a momentary thrill of compunction
at what he had done. But his innate selfishness soon
conquered this feeling. He had too many reasons
for wishing Harry away, to sympathize with his
mother.</p>

<p>“Very likely you’ll get a letter to-night,” he said.</p>

<p>“If not, I shall go to the city to-morrow morning,”
said Mrs. Raymond. “I am afraid something has
happened to Harry.”</p>

<p>Here was a chance for Squire Turner to make
what would be regarded as a friendly offer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Raymond,” he said, “it will be quite an
undertaking for you to go to the city, not to mention
the expense, which will, of course, be a consideration
with you. I was thinking of going there myself one
day next week, but as you are feeling anxious about
Harry, I will change my plans, and go to-morrow. I
will hunt up your son, and bring you home full particulars
about him. I don’t think, however, you need
to feel anxious.”</p>

<p>“O Squire Turner, will you, indeed?” said the
poor woman, gratefully. “You are very kind, and I
shall feel it as a great favor.”</p>

<p>“Certainly; it will give me great pleasure to
oblige you. If you have anything to send him, I will
carry it with pleasure.”</p>

<p>“If it wouldn’t be too much trouble, I will ask you
to carry a pair of stockings I have just footed for
him. And will you tell him to be sure to change his
stockings if he gets his feet wet?”</p>

<p>“I will, with pleasure, carry any message. But
why not write a note and send by me?”</p>

<p>“I think I will, if you will be so kind as to carry
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, don’t mention it! I hope, Mrs. Raymond
you will regard me as a near friend. If you will
write the letter in the course of the day, I will send
James round after supper to get it.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid it will be too much trouble for your
son.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, not at all,” said Squire Turner, cordially.</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond parted from the squire, feeling more
favorably disposed towards him than ever before.
To confess the truth, he had never been much of a
favorite of hers. His cold, disagreeable manners,
and his general reputation as a hard, close-fisted
man, had repelled not only her, but people generally.
But now he seemed wonderfully thawed out. He was
actually genial and cordial, and the manner in which
he had entered into her feelings about Harry, and his
kind offer to go to the city on a day he had not
intended, produced a strong impression upon her
mind.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think Squire Turner could be so kind,”
she said to herself. “I have done him injustice.
He has a good heart, after all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“James,” said Squire Turner, at the supper-table
that evening, “I want you to go over to Mrs. Raymond’s,
directly after supper.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked James.</p>

<p>“I am going to New York to-morrow morning, and
have agreed to carry a letter and small parcel to her
son Harry.”</p>

<p>James turned up his nose.</p>

<p>“Why don’t she come to the house, and bring it,
then?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I promised to send you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be Mrs. Raymond’s errand-boy.
Harry Raymond is a low upstart, and I shouldn’t
think you would be willing to carry bundles for
him.”</p>

<p>“That is my business,” said Squire Turner, who,
but for private reasons, might have shared his son’s
objections.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a headache,” said James. “I don’t feel
like going out.”</p>

<p>His father understood very well that this was not
true. Still he had always been in the habit of humoring
James in his whims, and now, instead of exerting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
his rightful authority as a parent to secure obedience,
he condescended to conciliate him.</p>

<p>“If you have a headache,” he said, “the fresh air
may do you good. Go as quick as you can, and
when you come back I will give you a dollar.”</p>

<p>This argument, addressed to his son’s selfishness,
prevailed. James had seen at the village store a
new fishing-pole, which he desired to buy, and with
the promised reward he could do so.</p>

<p>“Can’t you give me the money now?” he asked.
“There’s something I want to buy at the store, on
the way.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to go there after you return,” said
the squire, who at once saw that this was the best
way of securing a prompt return.</p>

<p>James took his cap and started for the cottage of
the Widow Raymond.</p>

<p>“The old man’s getting mighty obliging,” he muttered
to himself, meaning, of course, his father, by
the not very respectable term used. “I should be
too proud, if I were he, to carry bundles to that pauper,
Harry Raymond. Anyhow, I get a dollar by the
operation, and that’s something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Arrived at the cottage, James knocked sharply at
the outer door. It was opened almost immediately
by Mrs. Raymond herself.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, James,” she said, courteously.
“Won’t you walk in?”</p>

<p>“Can’t stop,” said James. “I’m in a great hurry.
Have you got that note ready you wanted to send
to the city?”</p>

<p>“I’ll get it in a moment. But you had better step
in.”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t,” said James, not taking the trouble
to acknowledge the invitation. “I am in a great
hurry.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond went back into her sitting-room,
and speedily reappeared with the note and the pair
of stockings wrapped in a brown paper.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to trouble you with this parcel,” she
said. “Your father was so kind as to offer to carry
it.”</p>

<p>“Umph!” muttered James, ungraciously.</p>

<p>“I am much obliged to him, and to you also for
your trouble in coming around for it.”</p>

<p>James did not deign a reply, but, turning his back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
marched off, feeling that he would rather have carried
a bundle for any one than for Harry Raymond.
If he could have known that at this very moment the
boy whom he hated so intensely was speeding away
from America, doing the duties of a sailor-boy, he
would have felt compensated for the disagreeable
nature of the favor he was so unwillingly doing.</p>

<p>Squire Turner went to the city the next day, as he
proposed. He went round to the office in Nassau
Street, temporarily occupied by Lemuel Fairchild,
the address having been communicated to him by
Mrs. Raymond, though this was hardly necessary, as
Hartley Brandon had apprised him by letter of the
details of the plot which they had mutually arranged.
Of course he found it locked, and the tenant gone.
The great commission house of Fairchild &amp; Co. had
mysteriously disappeared. In order to have something
to report, he called at the next room.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me,” he asked, “whether Mr. Fairchild
still occupies the adjoining room?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply; “he only occupied it for a
week, and then left. I understand that he left without
paying his rent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Squire Turner; “that surprises
me. I understood that he was at the head of a large
and responsible business house.”</p>

<p>The other laughed.</p>

<p>“If you had seen him, you would soon have corrected
your mistake. He was a seedy adventurer.
I don’t believe he was worth twenty-five dollars in
the world.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” repeated the squire; “I am concerned
to hear this. The fact is, the son of one of my neighbors—a
widow—came to the city to enter his
employ. One letter has been received from him, but
no other. His mother is feeling very anxious. How
long since they vacated the room?”</p>

<p>“I have not seen him for four or five days.”</p>

<p>“Did you see anything of the boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I saw a boy here last Monday, and on
Tuesday morning, but not since. Fairchild was here
for a few minutes in the afternoon; but he, too, has
been absent from that time.”</p>

<p>“Really this looks suspicious. What would you
advise me to do?” asked Squire Turner, with an
appearance of concern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lay the matter before the police authorities.
Most likely this Fairchild is a swindler, and they may
know something about him. I know of nothing else
to advise.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I believe I will follow your advice.
Good-morning.”</p>

<p>“Good-morning, sir.”</p>

<p>Squire Turner decided in reality to follow his
recommendation. Nothing was better adapted to
clear him personally of any suspicions of having had
a hand in Harry’s abduction, in the improbable contingency
of such suspicion being aroused. Besides
this, he was founding a claim to Mrs. Raymond’s
gratitude, which might lead her hereafter to regard
his suit with favor, in case he should find it politic to
seek her in marriage. He accordingly called at the
police head-quarters, and laid the case before the
authorities, taking care, however, not to be explicit,
as he had no wish to have Fairchild actually
arrested.</p>

<p>He also called at the office of a morning paper,
and, obtaining copies for the last three or four days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
read, with satisfaction, the record of the Sea Eagle’s
sailing.</p>

<p>“Now,” he thought to himself, “the field is clear,
and I can carry out my plans without interruption.”</p>

<span class="smaller">SEEKING FOR HARRY.</span></h2>

<p>Squire Turner arrived in Vernon in time for a late
supper. After partaking of it, he took his hat and
cane, and walked round to Mrs. Raymond’s cottage.
Seeing him from the window, she hastened to open
the door, and gazed with a look of anxious inquiry
into his face.</p>

<p>“Did you see Harry?” she asked quickly, forgetting
in her anxiety for her son even to bid the
squire good-evening.</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Raymond; but I will come in and tell
you all about it.”</p>

<p>His face was grave, and his voice was sympathetic.
The poor woman, her heart full of a terrible anxiety,
haunted by undefined fears, led the way into the
plain sitting-room, and then said, in a voice of
entreaty, “Tell me quick, Squire Turner, has anything
happened to my boy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us hope not, Mrs. Raymond. I assure you
I know of no harm that has come to him, but—I
could not find him.”</p>

<p>“You forgot the number?” she inquired, eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, I remembered the number. Besides, it was
on your letter and bundle. But I find that Mr. Fairchild
has moved from his office on Nassau Street.”</p>

<p>“Has moved—where?”</p>

<p>“That I could not learn. It seems that the office
was closed the day after your son’s arrival in New
York, that is, on Tuesday. I made inquiry of the
occupant of the next office, but that was all he could
tell me, except that he believed Mr. Fairchild had
gone away without paying his rent.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond looked surprised.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand it,” she said. “Harry wrote
that he was doing a large business. I thought the
firm was one of the largest in New York.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope that the information I received was
incorrect,” said the squire. “We will suppose that
Mr. Fairchild found it necessary to move, on account
of the demands of an extensive business. The office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
on Nassau Street was a small one, and I should
hardly suppose it would be adequate to his wants.”</p>

<p>“But Harry said nothing about moving. Besides,
if they did move, I should think he would
have written me since.”</p>

<p>“There is something in what you say,” the squire
answered. “In fact, I confess the affair has puzzled
me. It is possible, however, as I suggested the other
day, that he may have written, and the letter miscarried.”</p>

<p>“Do you think anything has happened to Harry,
Squire Turner?” asked Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>“I hope not.”</p>

<p>“But you think it possible?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what could have happened.”</p>

<p>“But it seems suspicious, Mr. Fairchild’s moving
away so quickly.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that does look suspicions,” admitted the
squire. “In fact, I thought it best to lay the matter
before the police authorities, so that if there is anything
wrong they may ferret it out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish that Harry had never gone to the
city!” murmured Mrs. Raymond, sorrowfully. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
was not in favor of it from the first. I tried to have
him stay at home, but he was possessed to go to the
city.”</p>

<p>“It is natural, Mrs. Raymond, that a spirited boy
should get tired of a small village like Vernon, and
want to enter a larger field. It may turn out all
right. Don’t decide too hastily that anything has
happened to him.”</p>

<p>“I shall not sleep any to-night. Squire Turner,
I think I must go to the city to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I would not advise you to do so, Mrs. Raymond.
You could do no good there. I have placed the
matter in the hands of the police authorities, and
whatever there is to be found out they will ascertain
and communicate to me.”</p>

<p>“But it seems so hard to wait in suspense.”</p>

<p>“That is true. I will tell you what I will do. I
know your anxiety, and if nothing should be heard
before next Tuesday, I will go to the city again,
and make what additional inquiries I can.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Squire Turner. You are truly kind.
How can I ever repay you for your great kindness?”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it, Mrs. Raymond. I know you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
have no one to look out for you now, and it is a
pleasure to me to feel that I am able to be of service.”</p>

<p>The squire took his leave, pressing Mrs. Raymond’s
hand gently, to indicate the sympathy which he felt
for her.</p>

<p>“I believe I played my part pretty well,” he said
to himself, as he went out. “She will never suspect
that I had anything to do with the abduction of her
son. When the affair has blown over a little, I will
go to Milwaukie, and see Robinson about the land
warrant, and its probable value. If the affair can be
compromised, so as to bring Mrs. Raymond ten
thousand dollars, I will offer myself. That will be a
pretty addition to my property. Besides, when her
son gets home, and finds that I am his mother’s husband,
his mouth will be shut about that confounded
fire. Maybe, he will fall overboard, and never come
back. If that happens, I shan’t shed many tears.
He is an obstinate, impracticable boy, and I shall be
rid of him.”</p>

<p>Thus the squire soliloquized.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, three days passed. It was Monday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
evening. Again he called to see the widow, now, as
it appeared, doubly bereft of husband and son.</p>

<p>“Have you had a letter, Mrs. Raymond?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, sorrowfully. “I hoped you
might have heard something.”</p>

<p>The squire shook his head.</p>

<p>“I wish I had any such news to give you,” he
said; “but I have heard nothing whatever.”</p>

<p>“I am sure Harry is dead,” said the poor mother,
bursting into tears.</p>

<p>“No, no, I am sure he is not,” said the squire,
soothingly. “There are twenty ways of accounting
for his silence, before adopting such an extreme view
as this.”</p>

<p>“I have hardly closed my eyes in sleep for the last
three nights,” said Mrs. Raymond; and her pale face
and swollen eyes testified to the literal correctness of
what she said.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry too much,” said the squire. “We
shall hear of Harry yet. To-morrow I will go to
the city again. If it will be any satisfaction to you,
I will invite you to accompany me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will go,” said the poor mother. “It will be
better than staying at home. I shall feel that I am
doing something to find my lost Harry. You are
very kind to invite me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” said the squire. “I will call
round in the morning, and carry you to the depot in
my carriage.”</p>

<p>“I will be ready.”</p>

<p>The next day, therefore, Squire Turner, accompanied
by Mrs. Raymond, went to New York. They
went round to the office in Nassau Street, but, as
may be expected, learned nothing in addition to the
facts previously gathered. Next, they went to the
office of the Superintendent of Police, but learned
nothing definite beyond this, that Lemuel Fairchild,
instead of being a responsible business-man, was a
needy adventurer. He had disappeared from the
city, and thus far the police had been unable to trace
him. What intention he could have had in pretending
to be a commission merchant, and, above all,
what could have induced him to send for Harry, was
a mystery which it seemed difficult to explain. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
superintendent promised to pursue his inquiries, and
to endeavor to obtain information concerning Harry
and his employer,—both of whom had strangely disappeared.
With this they were obliged to be content,
unsatisfactory as it was.</p>

<p>With a heavy heart Mrs. Raymond made her homeward
journey. Thus far she had thought only of the
personal grief she had suffered in the loss of Harry.
But another consideration very soon forced itself
upon her mind. In losing Harry, she had lost her
main support. How was she to sustain herself and
little Katy? Already the small amount of ready
money which her husband had left behind him was
exhausted, and as yet she knew of no way of earning
more. It was Squire Turner who first opened the
subject to her.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt,” he said, “that Harry will
return after a while, and explain his absence in a
satisfactory manner. But, meanwhile, you will, of
course, suffer inconvenience from the loss of his
wages. Have you thought of any plan?”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, wearily. “I have no pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
in living, now that my husband and son are
gone.”</p>

<p>“You must live for the sake of little Katy, and for
the sake of Harry, who will return some day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Katy will need me; Harry I shall never see
again.”</p>

<p>“You think so now; but I am sure he will return.
I have taken the liberty to form a plan for you, supposing
that you were too much occupied by your
grief to form any for yourself.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, Squire Turner.”</p>

<p>“I will advance you a hundred dollars, which can
be added to the mortgage I hold on your place. With
a part of it you can buy a sewing-machine, and take
in work. I am needing a dozen shirts made, if you
will undertake them.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond felt that this was a kind and wise
plan, and so expressed herself. Accordingly, the
sewing-machine was bought, and it was understood
that Mrs. Raymond was ready to take in sewing.
She obtained considerable employment, but not
enough to pay all her expenses. Every month she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
found herself going behindhand, and getting more
and more into debt to Squire Turner.</p>

<p>But we must leave her now, and follow the fortunes
of our young hero.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">SQUIRE TURNER’S LETTER.</span></h2>

<p>The affair of the caricature was suffered to pass
without the punishment of the guilty party. Had
not Harry found some one to clear him of the charge,
he would have fared badly from the captain’s brutality,
increased by his unfounded dislike. But in
Jack Rodman the offence was passed over. Probably
the captain suspected that the caricature had been
drawn with the object of getting our hero into
trouble, and that no insult was intended to himself.</p>

<p>It became evident to all on board that Harry was
an object of dislike to the captain. Brandon never
spoke to him except in a rough voice and with lowering
looks, and would gladly have shown his dislike
actively, but for the restraining presence of Mr. Weldon,
the supercargo, whose interest in our hero daily
grew stronger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Harry, he did his duty faithfully, as he had
determined. His position was not to his liking, and
he meant to escape from it whenever an opportunity
offered; but, until that time came, he thought it best
to give the captain no cause of complaint. He often
wondered whether Captain Brandon had invited him
on board with the intention of carrying him off to
sea. On this point he could not satisfy himself; for,
though it certainly looked like it, he could conceive
of no motive which Brandon could have for so acting.
He was, as he supposed, a total stranger to him until
the day before the vessel sailed. He concluded,
therefore, that his detention was only accidental, but
that the captain did not feel sufficient interest in him
to send him on shore in time.</p>

<p>But a short time afterwards he made a discovery
which threw a new and perplexing light upon his
abduction. He was sent down into the cabin one
day on an errand. While there, he saw an open
letter lying upon the floor. Picking it up, with the
intention of placing it on the table, he happened to
see his own name about the middle of the page. In
his surprise he let his eye travel over the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
of the letter. A light flashed upon him as he read,
and, commencing at the beginning, he made himself
acquainted with the whole letter. Then, because he
did not dare to stay longer, he hurriedly thrust it
into his pocket and went on deck.</p>

<p>That we may understand how far Harry was enlightened
by its perusal, the letter is subjoined:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hartley Brandon</span>:—Your letter, detailing the
steps which you have already taken, in order to carry
out the plan which I mentioned to you, is received.
I approve of all you have done. The most difficult
part of the programme,—getting the boy to the city—you
have ingeniously provided for. The offer of a
place in the city, with a salary of twelve dollars a
week, will, undoubtedly, be very tempting to an
ambitious boy like Harry Raymond. Now he is
employed temporarily in the village store at six dollars
a week, and that situation he must soon resign.
He will, undoubtedly, swallow the bait, and when
you have once got him to the city, you can easily
devise means for getting him on board your vessel
By the way, I congratulate you on your unexpected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
accession to the post of captain. It will pay you
better, and of course be more agreeable than that of
mate. Besides, it will give you full power over
young Raymond. If he should show signs of insubordination,
which is quite possible, for he is a high-spirited
boy, have no mercy upon him. Let him feel
your authority. Your voyage is fortunately a long
one, and by the time you return he will probably be
well tamed; if not, it will be your fault.</p>

<p>“I do not know that I have anything more to add,
except that of course you are never to mention my
name to Raymond, or lead him in any way to suspect
that there is any acquaintance between us. On this
point I am very particular, and should I discover that
you have broken your word, I should disown all
knowledge of the transaction, and withhold the
reward I promised. I enclose twenty-five dollars,
which you say you have promised to your confederate,
Lemuel Fairchild.”</p></div>

<p>This was the whole of the letter. It was not
signed, from motives of prudence, no doubt, for
otherwise Squire Turner would have placed himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
in the power of Brandon. But Harry was not for a
moment in doubt as to the name of the writer. He
was familiar with the squire’s handwriting, if there
had not been internal evidence to show that it was
written by him.</p>

<p>But the discovery was far from clearing up the
mystery. Why should Squire Turner enter into a plot
to kidnap him? Was it because Harry had been a
witness of the fire, and by his testimony could prevent
the squire from receiving his insurance money?
This was possible. At any rate Harry could think
of nothing else. Had he understood the further
motives which prompted Squire Turner’s action, he
would have felt still more anxious than at present.
Now he felt an eager wish to be at home, and confront
the squire with the evidence he had obtained, as
well as to prevent his obtaining money from the
insurance company on false pretences, as he felt persuaded
that he intended to do.</p>

<p>Our hero resolved to keep the letter he had accidentally
discovered. It was not his, but its connection
with him justified him, he thought, in retaining it.
As he might be suspected of having it, he hid it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
away, not wishing to have it found upon him in the
event of a search. But Captain Brandon did not
appear to miss it. At any rate, he made no inquiry
after it, and very probably supposed that it was still
in his possession.</p>

<p>Harry deliberated whether he should impart to any
one the information he had obtained. Tom Patch
was an honest fellow and a good friend, but he was
an illiterate sailor, and, though he could give sympathy,
his advice would be of little service. Mr. Weldon,
on the other hand, had not only shown himself
a friend, but he was a gentleman of education and
judgment. Harry felt that he would be a safe
counsellor. Accordingly, one day when a good
opportunity offered, he related to the supercargo the
discovery he had made, with enough of his home life
to make the account intelligible.</p>

<p>The young man listened in surprise.</p>

<p>“This is a strange story, Harry,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it is strange,” said our hero. “I could
not have believed that Squire Turner would have
treated me so meanly.”</p>

<p>“Your having seen him set fire to his house makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
it less strange. He could not draw the insurance
money if you chose to interfere.”</p>

<p>“I should have interfered,” said Harry, promptly.</p>

<p>“You would have been right in doing so. It
appears, then, that he was interested to the amount of
two thousand dollars in getting you out of the way.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said our hero; “but there is one thing I
can’t understand.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“He must have known that I would come back
from the voyage, and that I should learn whether he
had drawn the money. It would not be too late then
to expose him.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said the young man, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he said, after a little thought, fixing his
eyes seriously upon Harry, “he does not expect you
to come back at all.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Mr. Weldon?”</p>

<p>“I mean this; he has already shown himself capable
of one crime—he may be capable of another.
Evidently he has some secret understanding with
the captain, and he may have given him secret
instructions, of which we are not aware.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“You don’t think he would take my life?” said
Harry, his brown cheek turning a little pale at the
thought.</p>

<p>“I hope not. He might, however, leave you by design
on some lonely island in the sea. At any rate, it
will be necessary to be on your guard. I am very
glad you have told me what you have found out. I
will also be on the lookout, and if I find any danger
menacing you I will let you know.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Weldon,” said Harry, gratefully;
“I am very glad to have so good a friend.”</p>

<p>“You may depend on my friendship with confidence,”
said the supercargo, taking the boy’s hand
kindly. “I feel an interest in you, and no harm
shall come to you if I can help it.”</p>

<p>The suggestion of Mr. Weldon that possibly Squire
Turner did not expect him to return was a startling
one to our hero. He had lamented his necessary
absence for a year or more from home, and oftentimes
pictured to himself with pain the grief of his mother
when she learned of his mysterious disappearance.
He was afraid that she would suffer from narrow
means while he was away. Still he knew that she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
raise money on the house by a further mortgage,
enough probably to carry her through two years,
even if she did not earn anything during this period.
It would be a great pity to have her little property so
sacrificed; but Harry was hopeful, and meant when
he returned to make up to her for her losses. He
would be home in eighteen months, as he judged
from inquiries made of the sailors; at any rate in less
than two years, and this thought had sustained him
in his temporary separation. But now for the first
time the thought came to him that he might be prevented
from returning at all. Suppose it should
prove true, as the supercargo suggested, that Captain
Brandon should leave him on some lonely island in
the ocean, there to starve, or to drag out a solitary
and wretched existence, perhaps for years? This was
terrible to think of, yet he had heard and read of such
cases. He resolved not to be persuaded to land anywhere,
except at the termination of the voyage, and
thus avoid danger.</p>

<p>But, as often happens, the danger assumed a different
shape from what he anticipated. To explain the
evil which befell him, it is necessary to say that Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Rodman had not forgiven our hero for the signal and
public manner in which he had defeated him in the
contest already recorded. He cherished a malignant
hatred against Harry, and longed to do him some
harm. He was bound to get even with him, so he
said to himself. It was some time before an opportunity
presented itself. But at length one came.</p>

<p>Harry was leaning over the side one evening,
thinking over his position, when Jack Rodman’s
attention was drawn to him. He looked around him
hurriedly. Nobody was looking. A terrible impulse
seized him. He crept stealthily behind Harry, lifted
him from his feet, and in an instant threw him into
the sea.</p>

<p>“Help!” exclaimed Harry, in loud, clear tones.</p>

<p>Tom Patch heard, and recognized the voice. Instantly
he threw a plank overboard, calling out:—</p>

<p>“Keep up, my lad, and we’ll help you.”</p>

<p>The captain was just coming out of the cabin.
Tom ran up to him, and hurriedly announced that
Harry had fallen overboard.</p>

<p>“If he’s careless enough to fall overboard, let him
take care of himself,” said the captain, coolly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“Won’t you put out a boat?” asked Tom, anxiously.</p>

<p>The only answer was an oath, and a savage command
to go about his business.</p>

<p>All the while valuable time was being lost. Harry
was by this time some distance astern. He had
succeeded in reaching the plank, and was clinging
to it.</p>

<p>“Poor lad!” said Tom Patch, brushing a tear from
his eyes with his large and horny hand, and he
breathed an anathema against the captain, which I
cannot record. “He’s bound for Davy Jones’s
locker, as sure as my name’s Tom.”</p>

<p>There seemed little chance for our hero. With
nothing but a plank between him and immediate
destruction, alone in the vast ocean, without a particle
of food or drink to sustain him, the question of
“sink or swim” seemed little in doubt.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CAPTAIN AND THE SUPERCARGO.</span></h2>

<p>When Harry was so treacherously thrown overboard
by Jack Rodman, the supercargo was not on
deck. He had been attacked by a violent headache,
which had caused him to go below and “turn in,”
in the hope of obtaining a little sleep. In this he
at length succeeded, and when Harry’s life was
placed in jeopardy he was fast asleep. He did not
wake up for an hour or more. Feeling refreshed
he got up and went on deck. He looked round as
usual for Harry, but did not see him. His attention,
however, was drawn to Tom Patch, who, good,
honest fellow, every now and then raised his rough
hand to his eyes to brush away a tear.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Tom?” asked the supercargo,
for he had observed the rough sailor’s partiality
for Harry, and this had inclined him favorably
towards him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is it you, Mr. Weldon?” said Tom, in a subdued
tone. “I wish you’d been on deck an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Mayhaps you could have saved the poor lad.”</p>

<p>“Saved whom?” asked the supercargo, suspecting
at once that some harm had befallen Harry,
but not dreaming of the extent of his misfortune.</p>

<p>“He fell overboard, or was thrown over, I can’t
justly say which.”</p>

<p>“Whom do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Harry Raymond.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! How long since?”</p>

<p>“An hour and a half, maybe.”</p>

<p>“And was nothing done to save him?”</p>

<p>“I threw a plank when I heard him cry for
help.”</p>

<p>“And where was the captain when this happened?”
asked Weldon, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“In his cabin. I went down to tell him, and ask
to have a boat lowered to save the poor lad; but
he swore that if he was careless enough to fall
overboard he must save himself.”</p>

<p>The supercargo was not an excitable man, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
rather mild and pacific in his disposition; but when
he heard of the cold-blooded manner in which
Captain Brandon had refused help to the drowning
boy, he was filled with a just indignation, which
he was unable to conceal.</p>

<p>“Where is Captain Brandon?” he asked, in a
quick, stern voice, so unusual to him that Tom
looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>“In his cabin, Mr. Weldon. He gave orders
that he should not be disturbed.”</p>

<p>“That, for his orders!” returned the supercargo,
snapping his fingers contemptuously. “He <em>shall</em>
be disturbed, and he shall answer to me for his
atrocious inhumanity!” And Mr. Weldon hurried
to the rear of the companion-way.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think he had so much spirit,” said Tom,
as he followed with his glance the retreating form of
the supercargo, “he’s so mild-like, commonly. But
I’m glad the poor lad’s got some one that’ll dare to
speak up for him. I’d do it, but the captain’d
knock me down with a marlin-spike, and put me in
irons, likely, if I did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain’s attention was drawn to a quick,
imperative knock at the door of the cabin.</p>

<p>“Go away!” he growled. “I do not wish to
be disturbed.”</p>

<p>The only answer was a succession of knocks still
louder and more imperative.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix him for his insolence, whoever he is,”
the captain muttered, angrily, and, walking to the
cabin door, opened it himself.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Mr. Weldon?” he demanded,
in surprise and anger.</p>

<p>The young man’s face was white with anger, and
there was a suppressed fury in his tone, as he
replied, “I come here, Captain Brandon, to demand
why you have sacrificed a human life, by refusing
to make any effort to save the boy Harry Raymond.”</p>

<p>“I am not responsible to you for what I do or
decline to do, Mr. Weldon,” said Brandon, fiercely.
“It is none of your business.”</p>

<p>“It is my business, Captain Brandon, and the
business of every man on board who has a spark
of humanity in his bosom.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are insolent, sir.”</p>

<p>“Is this a time to choose words? You have suffered
that poor boy to perish when you might have
saved him, and in the eyes of Heaven you are responsible
for his murder.”</p>

<p>“Murder!”</p>

<p>Hartley Brandon was not a brave man. He was
disposed to bully and threaten, when he thought he
could do it with safety; but when he was opposed
in an intrepid and fearless manner, his tone became
milder and he lowered his pretensions. So, in the
present case, it startled him to be told that, in failing
to take means for the rescue of Harry, he had been
accessory to a murder, and he began to have undefined
apprehensions of the possible consequences
of his neglect. He thought it best to exculpate himself.</p>

<p>“Walk in, Mr. Weldon, and sit down,” he said.
“We will talk this matter over. You don’t understand
all the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“I hope I do not, Captain Brandon,” said the
young man, gravely. “I do not wish to think so
ill of you as I fear I must.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“The boy carelessly fell overboard,” commenced
the captain.</p>

<p>“Are you sure he fell?” asked the supercargo,
significantly.</p>

<p>“Of course he fell. How else could it be? I
don’t understand you.”</p>

<p>“It seems strange that he should be so careless.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way of it. He didn’t deserve to be
helped. Can I be expected to stop my ship every
time a careless boy takes a notion to fall overboard?”</p>

<p>“When a human life is in jeopardy, Captain
Brandon, our duty is to save it if we can. I don’t
envy the man who at such a time can stop to inquire
whether the danger is the result of carelessness or
not.”</p>

<p>The supercargo spoke sternly, and the captain
felt arraigned for his action, and this irritated
him.</p>

<p>“I have to think of my ship,” he said.</p>

<p>“In what way would it have injured the ship, if
you had lowered the boat for Harry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“I cannot afford to lose time.”</p>

<p>“Have you thought how much time the poor boy
has lost, whose life is probably a sacrifice to your
criminal negligence? A life which, in all probability,
would have been prolonged to seventy,
has been cut short at fifteen. Fifty-five years lost
to save one hour in the voyage of the Sea Eagle!”
said Weldon, scornfully.</p>

<p>“I am not responsible to you, Mr. Weldon,” said
Brandon, with irritation, “I acted as I thought
for the best. I am the captain of this ship, not
you.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that. Captain Brandon. But
you could not expect me to stand by and see a
human life sacrificed without uttering my earnest
protest. Any life would be worth saving,—the
life of this bright, manly boy more than most. His
death lies at your door.”</p>

<p>“You have said as much before,” said the captain,
sulkily. “If you have no more to say, I will
trouble you to leave me to myself.”</p>

<p>“I have something more to say,” said the supercargo,
regarding the captain fixedly. “I am aware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of the manner in which this boy was entrapped on
board your vessel. What motive you had in carrying
him away from home and friends I do not know.
You perhaps know, also,” the young man continued,
“whether in leaving him to his sad fate you are not
influenced by a similar motive.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Mr. Weldon?” demanded
the captain, startled by the words and tone of the
other.</p>

<p>“I mean this: that in this whole affair there is
something which I do not understand,—something
that has excited my suspicions. I shall feel it my
duty to report all that I know of it to the authorities
at the first opportunity.”</p>

<p>Brandon turned pale. He began to see that he
had made a mistake, and exposed himself to grave
suspicions. It would have been better, as he now
perceived, to make a show of rescuing our hero. It
would have been easy to secure failure by unnecessary
delay. The threat of a legal investigation
alarmed him, and he prepared to make an argument
by which he might dispel, if possible, the impression
which had been created in the mind of the supercargo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
But Mr. Weldon rose, and left the cabin hastily.
The interview had been a most unsatisfactory one,
and had only convinced him of what he feared,—that
the captain was, in reality, either glad to be rid of
our hero, even by such means, or else indifferent to
his fate. He was inclined to believe in the former
theory. What he had said of laying the matter
before the authorities, he was fully decided upon.
Now the vehemence of his indignation gave place to
a feeling of the deepest and most poignant sorrow for
the loss of the boy who had unconsciously become
very dear to him. He thought of his frank, manly
bearing, of his pleasant face, of his courtesy and
politeness, and the warm and generous heart of which
he had shown himself to be possessed, and then of the
terrible fate which had so unexpectedly overtaken
him, and the tears rose unbidden to his eyes. By
this time, doubtless, Harry was beyond human
succor, and all that he could do was to drop a tear to
his memory. He went up to Tom Patch, towards
whom the sailor’s evident grief for our hero’s fate had
warmed his heart, and wrung his hand heartily.</p>

<p>“He was a noble boy, and his life has been shamefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
sacrificed, Tom,” he said; “but if I live, the
man who has done this deed shall be punished.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir,” said Tom, whose voice was gruff
with emotion; “I hope you’ll stick to that. He was
a brave lad, and the captain deserves to be pitched
after him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Weldon paced the deck till far into the night.
Captain Brandon shut himself up in his cabin, and
did not show himself till morning. He had made
various advances towards the supercargo, whom he
evidently desired to conciliate, from prudential intentions;
but the young man met him with a freezing
formality, which showed him that all hopes in that
direction were futile.</p>

<p>So the Sea Eagle sped on its way, till at length it
arrived at its destined port.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">ADRIFT.</span></h2>

<p>The attack made upon our hero was so sudden and
so rapidly executed, that there was no opportunity
for resistance. Before he well knew what had happened
to him he found himself struggling in the
ocean. Instinct led him to strike out. In response
to his cry the plank was thrown overboard, as we
know. He saw it and swam towards it. Fortunately
he was an expert swimmer, and had no difficulty
in reaching it.</p>

<p>He got upon the plank and supported himself by
it. Then, for the first time, he was able to look
towards the Sea Eagle. It was speeding away from
him, not rapidly, for there was a light wind, but
surely.</p>

<p>“Surely they will lower a boat for me,” thought
our hero, anxiously.</p>

<p>He had heard Tom Patch’s shout of encouragement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and he knew Tom would not let him perish, if
he could help it. He did not suspect that the captain
would be inhuman enough to refuse assistance.
So he gazed anxiously, but still hopefully, at the
receding ship, wondering why there was such a delay
in getting out the boat. But when five minutes had
elapsed, and, straining his eyes in the uncertain
light, he could see no preparations going forward for
a rescue, the thought flashed upon him in all its
horror that he was to be left to his fate. And what
a fate! Thousands of miles from home, adrift on the
vast ocean, with only a plank between him and
destruction. Could anything be more fearful?</p>

<p>At present the ocean was comparatively calm.
There was little breeze, and so no high waves were
excited. He could float without any great difficulty
in clinging to the plank. But this could not be
expected to last. To-morrow the waves might sweep
him from his sole refuge, and to certain destruction.
Besides, he had neither food nor drink. Even were
he able to cling to the plank, hunger and thirst would
soon make his condition insupportable. There was
still another consideration. It would not do for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
to sleep. Should he lose consciousness, his hold of
the plank would, of course, relax, and he would be
drowned.</p>

<p>All these thoughts crowded upon our young hero,
and, hero though we call him, a feeling of bitter
despair came to him. Was this to be the end of all
his glowing hopes and bright anticipations of future
prosperity? Was he never to see his mother and his
little sister Katy again? He felt at this terrible
moment how he loved them both, and, anxious as he
was for himself, with death staring him in the face,
he could not help thinking how his death would affect
these dear ones, and anxiously considered how they
would be able to get along without him. When the
property was gone, how would his mother get along?</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could but live for mother and Katy!”
thought the poor boy. “I would work for them
without a murmur. But it is horrible to die in the
wild ocean so for away from home.”</p>

<p>He was not troubled by drowsiness, for in the
tumult of his feelings he could not have composed
himself to sleep under any circumstances. His mind
was preternaturally active. Now he thought of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
mother, now of his school-mates, and his happy
school-days at the Vernon High School, of the many
good times he had enjoyed hunting for nuts, or picking
berries, or playing ball with the boys. Then he
thought of Squire Turner, and wondered how he
would feel when he heard of his death. Would he be
glad that there was no more chance of his being exposed
as the incendiary of his own building? Harry
hardly knew what to think. It never occurred to
him to suspect that Squire Turner was responsible
for his abduction and for his present condition.</p>

<p>So the night wore slowly away. When the first
gray streaks of dawn broke upon the ocean, the Sea
Eagle was more than fifty miles away. Harry was
still wakeful. His intense mental action had kept
sleep at a distance.</p>

<p>As soon as the light had increased a little he began
to look about anxiously in every direction. There
was one chance of life, and he clung to that. He
might be seen from some approaching vessel and
picked up. This chance was small enough. The
avenues of the ocean are so many and so broad, that
no ship can be depended upon to keep the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
another. What chance was there, in the brief time
Harry could hope to hold out, that any vessel would
come near enough for him to be seen and rescued?</p>

<p>But it is said that drowning men will cling to a
straw, and Harry was in immediate danger of drowning.
His thoughts were fixed in all their intensity
upon the remote contingency of a vessel’s passing.
He almost forgot that he was hungry. But, as the
morning advanced, the craving for food made itself
unpleasantly felt. There was a gnawing at his
stomach (for he had eaten but lightly the evening
before), which there was no chance of appeasing.
Harry knew well that this feeling would grow stronger
and stronger, until it became so agonizing as to
make life a burden. But there was always one relief,
though a desperate one. He could release his hold
of the plank, and sink down into the deep waves,
which, merciless as they were, were more merciful
than hunger and thirst, for while the first brings protracted
agony, the last affords a speedy relief for all
trouble.</p>

<p>After a while, thirst as well as hunger began to
torment him. The salt meat, which affords the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
staple of a sailor’s diet, induces thirst more rapidly
than ordinary food. So by noon his throat was
parched with thirst. He felt the tantalizing character
of his situation; “Water, water everywhere, but
not a drop to drink.” He was half tempted to taste
of the water in which he was immersed; but he knew
that, so far from affording relief, it would only entail
additional suffering, and, strong though the temptation
was, he had the prudence and self-denial to forbear.</p>

<p>Then, besides, partly owing to his sleeplessness,
his head began to throb with pain, and, altogether,
the poor boy’s situation was becoming desperate. It
seemed as if his career was likely to terminate very
speedily.</p>

<p>While our hero is in this precarious condition, we
must, for a brief time, change the scene.</p>

<p>Sailing steadily towards him, though he knew it
not, was the Australian packet-ship Rubicon, bound
from Liverpool to Melbourne.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant day, and most of the passengers
were on deck, enjoying the calm weather. Some had
been sea-sick; but even those who were most inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
to be disturbed by this most disagreeable of maladies,
could find no good cause for keeping below on so
pleasant a day. The sea was tranquil, the movement
of the vessel calm and steady, and as such days are
not often to be reckoned upon, the passengers determined
to make the most of this.</p>

<p>Among the passengers were David Lindsay, a gentleman
of middle age, and his daughter Maud, a
bright, handsome girl of thirteen. Mr. Lindsay was
a London merchant, who, partly for the benefit of his
health, which had been affected by too great devotion
to business, partly because he had business interests
in Australia, had decided to go out to Melbourne on
a visit. He had not at first proposed to take his
daughter, considering her too young; but she was an
only child, and, as her mother was dead, had been
treated by her father more as a companion than is
usual with girls of her age. So, when her father mentioned
his plan, Maud at once said confidently, “Oh,
that will be charming, papa! How much I shall
enjoy it!”</p>

<p>“How much you will enjoy it,” repeated her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
father. “Well, Maud, I can’t say that your remark
is particularly complimentary to me.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Maud, innocently.</p>

<p>“I tell you that I am going to Australia,—a journey
likely to keep me away from home a year at
least, and you are so ready to part with me that you
say at once that it is charming.”</p>

<p>“But, papa,” said Maud, “we shall not be separated
at all.”</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?”</p>

<p>“<em>Of course</em> you are going to take me with you!”
and Maud put a strong emphasis on the first two
words.</p>

<p>“You seem to be pretty confident, considering that
such an idea never entered my head,” said her father.</p>

<p>“What, papa! You don’t mean to say that you
thought of leaving me here in England?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my child.”</p>

<p>“But you know, papa, I can’t stay away from you
so long. I’m sure you’re going to take me with
you.” And she put her arms coaxingly around his
neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what is to become of your education in the
mean time, Maud?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that can wait.”</p>

<p>“You dispose of that difficulty very easily,” said
her father, amused.</p>

<p>“Why, you see, papa, I am not so terribly old
I’ve got plenty of time before me, so that I can spare
a year well enough. Besides, I shall be learning
something from observation. My governess says that
there are two great sources of instruction: one of
these is the study of books; and the other, and perhaps
the more valuable of the two, is the right use of
the faculty of observation.”</p>

<p>In saying this she imitated the prim, methodical
tone of her governess, an elderly spinster, at whose
little peculiarities Mr. Lindsay had often been
secretly amused.</p>

<p>He laughed outright at the excellent imitation
given of Miss Pendleton’s manner, and Maud saw
that her suit was half won.</p>

<p>“You ought to be a lawyer, Maud,” he said,
“you are so good at special pleading.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“That means that I am going, I suppose, papa?”
said Maud, promptly.</p>

<p>“Not so fast. I have got to think it over. I
must ask Miss Pendleton what she thinks of it.”</p>

<p>“If you do, papa, will you be kind enough to
repeat that remark I made about the two sources of
knowledge?”</p>

<p>“No, Maud, I don’t think I shall venture upon
such a thing. However, I will take your request
into consideration.”</p>

<p>“Into a <em>favorable</em> consideration, papa.”</p>

<p>“As to that, I cannot promise.”</p>

<p>Maud, however, felt tolerably assured that she had
gained her point, as indeed she had. Mr. Lindsay
had been dreading his Australian trip mainly because
it would separate him from his daughter. Now
he began to look forward to it with interest and
pleasure. Strange to say, the thought of taking his
daughter had never before occurred to him. Yet
there seemed no good reason for not doing it. She
was young, and there was plenty of time to obtain an
education, as she had herself said. Besides, the
remark of her governess had considerable truth in it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Observation would be a valuable source of information.</p>

<p>He consulted Miss Pendleton, offering her a year’s
vacation on half salary, and found her very ready to
accept it. It was many years that she had been
teaching in different families, and the prospect of a
year’s respite, with such pecuniary inducements as
would relieve her from loss or anxiety, was a pleasant
one. It would enable her to visit the family of a
married sister, and renew the familiar intercourse
which her mode of life for many years had rendered
impracticable.</p>

<p>So it happened that when the packet Rubicon
sailed, in the list of passengers were Mr. David
Lindsay and daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsay was sea-sick a fortnight, Maud
scarcely at all. The dismal hours in which he was a
victim to this disagreeable complaint were made
much less intolerable by the services and bright,
cheerful companionship of his daughter, so that the
merchant more than once felt thankful that he had
yielded to her entreaties, and made her the companion
of his trip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Maud and her father were standing by the side of
the vessel, looking out at the broad waste of waters,
without any definite object in view. Suddenly Maud
exclaimed, “Papa, look there, and tell me what you
see!”</p>

<p>She pointed to the east. He shook his head.
“Your eyes are better than mine, Maud,” he said.
“I can see nothing.”</p>

<p>“Papa,” she said, energetically, “I am sure I can
see a boy in the water supported by a plank.”</p>

<p>The captain was on deck with his spy-glass. Mr.
Lindsay went up to him and told him what Maud had
said. He turned his glass in the direction indicated.</p>

<p>“The young lady is right,” he said. “It is a boy
adrift upon a plank.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">NEW FRIENDS.</span></h2>

<p>“A boy adrift!” repeated Mr. Lindsay. “How
could he get into such a situation?”</p>

<p>“There may have been a wreck,” said the captain;
“though I can see no other indications of it,” as
through his glass he scanned the sea in the neighborhood
of Harry.</p>

<p>“You’ll go after him, won’t you, Captain Scott?”
asked Maud, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Certainly, my dear young lady; I will save him
if I can.”</p>

<p>“It must be so terrible to be out in the sea with
nothing but a plank to hold on to,” said Maud, sympathetically.
“I hope he’ll hold on till we get
there.”</p>

<p>“He lies nearly in our course. In twenty minutes
we shall reach him.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Harry, scanning the sea anxiously, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
caught sight of the Rubicon. A wild thrill of hope
stirred his heart. Here, at last, was a chance of life.
But would they see him? That was the momentous
question. Had he anything by which he might
attract attention?</p>

<p>He felt in his pocket, and drew out his handkerchief.
Had it been dry, he could have waved it
aloft. But it was dripping wet, and there was no
wave to it. His spirits began to sink. But there
was one encouragement: the packet was heading
for him. Though he might not be seen now, he
would perhaps be able to attract attention when the
ship drew near.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes passed in the most anxious suspense.
How much depended on the next quarter of
an hour! In that time it would be decided whether
he should live or die. Already he could discern the
figures of the passengers. Was it a delusion? No,
a little girl was waving her handkerchief to him. He
was seen,—he would be rescued! He became so weak,
in the tumult of his sudden joy, that he released his
hold of the plank which had been his safeguard, and,
as it proved, his deliverance. But he recovered from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
his weakness, and with renewed energy clung to the
plank.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the Rubicon. He saw
preparations for lowering a boat. The boat was in
the water, and four sturdy sailors impelled it towards
him with vigorous strokes. Five minutes later he
was helped into the boat, and a little later still he
clambered on board the Rubicon,—a silent prayer
of thanksgiving in his heart to the Almighty Father
for his providential rescue.</p>

<p>“Well, my lad,” said Captain Scott, advancing
towards him, “you’ve had a pretty narrow escape.
We don’t generally stop here to take in passengers.”</p>

<p>“Captain,” said Harry, earnestly, “I thank you
for saving my life. I couldn’t have held out much
longer.”</p>

<p>“No, I should think not. How came you in such
a pickle? But I won’t ask you to tell the story
now. You’re wet, and I suppose hungry.”</p>

<p>Our hero admitted that he was both hungry and
thirsty, having been without food or drink for nearly
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Luckily there was a boy on board, of about Harry’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
size. Our hero was supplied with a suit of his
clothes, which he found considerably more comfortable
than the one he had on, which, having been subjected
to the action of the sea-water for twenty
hours, was about as thoroughly drenched as it was
possible for clothes to be. After being provided
with dry clothing, Harry’s other wants were attended
to. A bowl of hot coffee and a plentiful supply of
hearty food made him feel very much more at his
ease.</p>

<p>He was now called upon for his story. This he
told frankly and without reservation to the captain
and the passengers who had gathered about him.
His manner was so modest, manly, and self-possessed,
that no one for a moment questioned the truth of
what he said, and all were prepossessed at once in his
favor.</p>

<p>“Well, youngster,” said Captain Scott, “it appears
that you’ve had rather a rough experience. I’ll try
to treat you a little better than did Captain Brandon.
We sea-captains are not all black sheep. There are
some of us, I hope, that have common humanity.”</p>

<p>Captain Scott was a bluff, hearty sailor, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
a large heart, full of kindly impulses. In times of
danger he was rough and dictatorial, as was perhaps
necessary, but at other times he followed the dictates
of a kind heart and generous nature, treating the
sailors under his command so well that no one would
leave him unless obliged to do so.</p>

<p>Among those who listened with the greatest interest
to Harry’s story was Maud Lindsay. When it was
over she called her father aside.</p>

<p>“Papa,” she said, “I have a favor to ask.”</p>

<p>“Well, puss?”</p>

<p>“I want you to be kind to this boy,—Harry
Raymond.”</p>

<p>“How do you want me to be kind to him?”</p>

<p>“I want you to pay his passage to Melbourne, and
help him after he gets there.”</p>

<p>“Whew, Maud! You seem to have taken a sudden
interest in the young man. I suppose you will be
wanting to marry him when we get to Melbourne.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, papa!” said Maud, blushing.</p>

<p>“Tell me, then, why I should spend so much
money on a stranger.”</p>

<p>“You know you’ve got plenty of money, papa, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
he has been very unfortunate. He’s such a nice-looking
boy too.”</p>

<p>“I suppose if he were only unfortunate, and not
nice-looking,—if he had red hair, and a face marked
with the small-pox,—you would not be so anxious
to have me help him along?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t suppose I should feel quite so much
interest in him,” Maud admitted. “Do you like
homely persons as well as handsome ones, papa?”</p>

<p>“Why, that is rather a delicate question to ask.
All I can say is, that I love you just as much as if
you were good-looking.”</p>

<p>“That’s as much as to say I am not,” returned
Maud.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say so.”</p>

<p>“But you meant so. However, everybody says I
look like you; so, if I am homely, you are also.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got me there, Maud,” said Mr. Lindsay,
laughing. “After this I shall never dare to question
your good looks.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do as I want you to, then, papa?” said
Maud, laying her hand with a coaxing gesture on
her father’s arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose I shall have to,” said her father,
smiling.</p>

<p>“That’s a good papa. I’ll kiss you now.”</p>

<p>“I will submit to the infliction with as good
a grace as possible,” said Mr. Lindsay, with a comic
look of resignation.</p>

<p>It will be perceived that the relations between Mr.
Lindsay and his daughter were more cordial and
affectionate than is sometimes the case. He had a
warm, kindly nature, and the death of his wife had
led him to centre all his love and all his hopes upon
his daughter, who, we must acknowledge, was attractive
and lovable enough to justify any father’s love
and pride. Warm-hearted and impulsive, she won
the affection of all who surrounded her, and had even
made a considerable impression upon the not very
susceptible heart of her strait-laced and prim governess,
Miss Pendleton.</p>

<p>Though he had made a playful opposition to the
request of his daughter, Mr. Lindsay was from the
first favorably disposed towards granting it. He, too,
had been pleased with the frank, manly bearing of
Harry Raymond, and had been interested in the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of his life. He felt impelled to help him, as he
could well afford to do, and to make up to him for the
frowning of fortune by securing to him a more prosperous
future.</p>

<p>Accordingly he sought Captain Scott immediately
after his interview with Maud.</p>

<p>“I want to speak to you about this boy you have
picked up, Captain Scott,” he commenced.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking about him myself. If I had
anything for him to do, I would let him work his passage.
As it is, I suppose I shall have to give it to
him. But that won’t set him right entirely. He’ll
land at Melbourne without a penny, with no means of
reaching home.”</p>

<p>“I’ll relieve you from all anxiety on that point,
captain. I’ve taken a fancy to the boy. You may
charge me the amount of his passage-money, and I’ll
take care of him when we get to Melbourne.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Lindsay; but if you’ll do the last,
I’ll give him a free passage. I like the youngster
myself, and am willing to do that much for him.”</p>

<p>“Then suppose we call him and let him know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
we propose to do? No doubt he is feeling somewhat
anxious about his future.”</p>

<p>Harry, being summoned, presented himself. He had
meanwhile learned the destination of the Rubicon,
and had hardly made up his mind how to feel about
it. With a boy’s love of adventure and strange lands,
he was fascinated by the thought of seeing Australia,
of which he had heard so much. Still he could not
help reflecting that he would land penniless, separated
by half the earth’s circumference from his home
and mother and sister that he loved. Could he
make a living in this strange land, of which he knew
nothing, and could he ever earn money enough in
addition to pay for his homeward passage? These
were questions which it was very easy to ask, but not
quite so easy to answer. Still, in spite of his doubts
on this point, his situation was so much better than it
had been, and he was so thankful for his deliverance
from a terrible death, that he was disposed to regard
the future hopefully.</p>

<p>“Well, youngster,” said the captain, as our hero
made his appearance, “I suppose you are ready to
settle for your passage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry smiled.</p>

<p>“I should like to,” he said, “but I haven’t got a
cent.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see but I shall have to throw you
overboard again, eh, Mr. Lindsay?”</p>

<p>“Can’t I work my passage?” suggested our hero.</p>

<p>“No, we are full-handed. However, as you can’t
pay, I’ve about made up my mind to give you your
passage free.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, Captain Scott,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Quite welcome, my lad. Here’s a gentleman who
will do more for you than I can.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you have felt some anxiety about how
you will get along when you arrive at Melbourne?”
said Mr. Lindsay.</p>

<p>Harry admitted his anxiety.</p>

<p>“You may lay aside all apprehensions, then. I
will take care that you suffer for nothing, and will
see what I can do to put you in a way of earning
your living.”</p>

<p>“You are kinder to me than I deserve,” said our
hero, surprised and grateful.</p>

<p>“I do this at my daughter’s request,” said Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Lindsay. “She was the first to see you from the
deck, and now she has asked me to interest myself
in your favor.”</p>

<p>Harry heard this with pleasure. He had noticed
Maud Lindsay, and had been quite charmed by her
bright, attractive face, and it was pleasant to him to
learn that she felt an interest in him. He expressed
his gratitude to her.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” said Mr. Lindsay, “and you
shall thank her in person.”</p>

<p>Harry accompanied his new friend with a degree
of bashfulness, for he was not much accustomed to
young ladies’ society. But he soon found himself at
ease with Maud. She had numberless questions to
ask, which he took pleasure in answering. Then he,
too, asked questions about London, where she had
hitherto lived. So they got on excellently together,
and for the remainder of the voyage were almost
inseparable. But upon the details of their growing
friendship, however interesting to the parties themselves,
I have no room to speak. Sea-life is monotonous,
and it may be as well passed over briefly.
Enough to say that the weeks sped on, and at length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
one pleasant morning the Rubicon ascended the
Yarra Yarra River, and the impatient voyagers gazed
with eager interest at the principal city in Australia,
which, with its handsome buildings and wide, straight
streets, now lay stretched out before them.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF MELBOURNE.</span></h2>

<p>It will readily be believed that our hero surveyed
with eager interest the city which lay before him.
Melbourne was not so large and populous as at present,
but it presented an unusually lively and animated
appearance. It was in the height of the gold excitement,
and multitudes had flocked thither from all
parts of the world, so that representatives of every
nationality might be found in the streets of Australia’s
capital. But we are anticipating a little.</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsay, Maud, and Harry stood on the deck
of the vessel, waiting for the ship to be secured,
that they might go on shore. Mr. Lindsay’s mind
was quite at ease, for he had money, and money
would provide him with all the comforts and luxuries
which he could desire. But with Harry it was different.
He realized the helplessness of the situation,
and, despite his pluck, it made him feel a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
uneasy. He knew that Mr. Lindsay had an interest
in him, but he did not like to presume upon that
interest.</p>

<p>“Well, my boy,” said Mr. Lindsay, “are you
ready to go on shore?”</p>

<p>Harry hesitated.</p>

<p>“I should like to go,” he said.</p>

<p>“I have just ordered my trunks brought on deck,”
said the merchant. “In half an hour I think we
may be on shore.”</p>

<p>“Then I will bid you good-by, sir,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Good-by! What for?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Harry, what for?” echoed Maud.</p>

<p>“Because we are going to part.”</p>

<p>“No, we are not. You are going with us.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Harry, hesitating, “I could not afford
to stop where you do.”</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble yourself about that,” said Mr.
Lindsay, kindly. “I feel an interest in you, and so
does Maud.”</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” said Maud, so decidedly that
Harry blushed, not being accustomed to hear himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
spoken of in such such complimentary terms by a
young lady.</p>

<p>“Therefore,” proceeded Mr. Lindsay, “I mean
to take you on shore with me, and I will afterwards
give you time to form your plans, in which I shall
give you such assistance as I can.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, sir,” said Harry, gratefully.</p>

<p>“Then you will go with us, Harry,” said Maud,
“won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I shall be very glad to do so,” said Harry. “You
are very kind to me, Miss Lindsay.”</p>

<p>“Miss Lindsay!” repeated the young lady, impatiently.
“What makes you call me that?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it your name?” asked Harry, smiling.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t. At any rate you are not to call me
so. Call me Maud.”</p>

<p>“Well, Maud, I will, if you want me to.”</p>

<p>“Certainly I do. I wish we could go on shore;
I am tired of staying here.”</p>

<p>They had not long to stop, however. They were
soon on the pier, where a number of carriages were
waiting to convey passengers to the various hotels.
Mr. Lindsay had previously inquired which was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
best hotel in the city, and gave directions to the
driver to convey him thither. As I do not wish to
discriminate in favor of any particular hotel, I shall
call it by an assumed name, “The Tasmania Hotel.”</p>

<p>It had a handsome appearance, being located on
Collins Street, which is the principal business street
in Melbourne. This street is about one third wider
than Broadway, and had, even in the days of which I
am writing, many handsome shops and imposing
buildings.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know Melbourne was such a nice place,”
said Maud, looking about with satisfaction. “Why,
they’ve got as nice shops here as they have in London.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Melbourne is quite an enterprising city,”
said Mr. Lindsay.</p>

<p>“I like it better than London for one reason,” continued
Maud.</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“It is brighter and more cheerful. In London it
is almost always foggy.”</p>

<p>“I should like to deny that, being a true Briton,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
said Mr. Lindsay; “but I am afraid I must admit
that London is open to that objection.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I am going to do this afternoon
papa.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p>“I’m going out shopping.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I can’t go with you this afternoon,
Maud. I shall be occupied with business.”</p>

<p>“There is no need of your going with me, papa.”</p>

<p>“But I should not be willing to have you go alone,
Maud,” said her father.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to go alone. Harry’ll go with me,
and protect me, only I don’t think I shall need any
protection; but it’ll be pleasant to have him go.”</p>

<p>“If he is willing to go, I have no objection.”</p>

<p>“You’ll come with me, Harry, won’t you?” asked
Maud.</p>

<p>“I shall be very happy to accompany you,
Miss—”</p>

<p>Here Maud held up her finger warningly.</p>

<p>“I mean Maud,” said our hero.</p>

<p>“Then that’s settled. We’ll have lots of fun.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid that is not quite the way young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
ladies ought to talk,” said her father. “What would
your governess say?”</p>

<p>“Poor, dear old lady! she’d be shocked, I know
she would. She wanted me to be as prim and stupid
as herself. But I can’t be, papa. It is not in me.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think it is,” said her father, smiling.</p>

<p>They were assigned pleasant rooms in the hotel;
in fact, the best in the house. Mr. Lindsay, though
not an extravagant man, was always liberal in all
his arrangements when travelling; and now especially,
when he had his daughter with him, he was
resolved to spare no expense to secure such comforts
as could be procured. Harry also was provided with
a pleasant apartment on the same floor. Mr. Lindsay
might easily have secured for him a cheaper one
on an upper floor; but he was apparently resolved
to treat Harry as if he were a member of his own
family.</p>

<p>They ordered an early dinner, being tired of ship
fare, and anxious for the fresher vegetables and meat
which could be obtained on shore. According to the
English system, they took their meal privately in Mr.
Lindsay’s apartment. It proved to be well cooked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and of good quality, and each of the three did full
justice to it.</p>

<p>When the meal was over, Mr. Lindsay said:—</p>

<p>“I must go out now and make a business call,
leaving you young people to your own devices.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go out shopping and sight-seeing, papa, as
I told you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go too far, or you might get lost.”</p>

<p>“Never fear that. But there’s one thing you
mustn’t forget, papa.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“What does a young lady always want when she
goes out shopping?”</p>

<p>“Some money?”</p>

<p>“You’ve guessed right the first time.”</p>

<p>“You won’t want much. What do you wish to
buy?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell, papa, till I see what they have got
to sell.”</p>

<p>“Here, then,” said Mr. Lindsay, placing two gold
sovereigns in his daughter’s hand. “Mind and don’t
spend it foolishly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you ever know me spend money foolishly,
papa?”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps I had better not express myself on
that point. Good-by for a few hours.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsay went out, and Maud and Harry soon
followed. They walked along Collins Street, looking
about them with eager interest. They met German,
English, French, Chinese; in fact, types of nearly all
nationalities. This seemed more strange to Maud
than to Harry, for in New York the latter had been
accustomed to see a mingling scarcely less great of
heterogeneous elements. But in London, or, at any
rate, in those parts with which Maud was familiar,
there was far less diversity.</p>

<p>“I like this,” said Maud, with satisfaction.
“Everything looks so new and strange. It’s ever so
much better fun than being in London. Besides, if I
were in London, instead of having you to walk about
with me, I should have a stiff old governess calling
out every moment, ‘You should be more particular
about your deportment, Miss Maud.’ Now I know
you won’t say anything about my deportment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I think not,” said Harry. “I don’t know
what a young lady’s deportment ought to be.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that, for you won’t be turning up the
whites of your eyes at me in horror at anything I say
or do. Oh, there’s some ribbon I want! Do you see
it in that window? Come in with me, Harry.”</p>

<p>They went in, and Maud made a purchase of some
ribbon, which she declared to be of a lovely shade.</p>

<p>Now it must be confessed that Maud sometimes
allowed her high spirits to carry her too far. She
was of an excitable, impulsive temperament. Still
her impulses were generous and kindly, and in spite
of her faults she was unusually attractive, and it was
difficult not to be won over by her frank, affectionate
manner. So Harry, who was not much used to the
society of young ladies, and, as he said, did not very
well know what deportment was proper for them,
considered Maud to be very agreeable, and felt grateful
for her kindness to himself.</p>

<p>After buying the ribbon, Maud walked on for some
little distance till she came to a gentleman’s furnishing
store.</p>

<p>“I want to go in here, Harry,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>“They only sell articles for gentlemen in there,”
said Harry.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Maud. “I know what I
want. Come in.”</p>

<p>Entering the shop, Maud took the lead, and,
advancing to the counter, asked the shopman:—</p>

<p>“Will you show me some of your cravats?”</p>

<p>“For yourself, miss?” asked the shopman, surprised.
“We don’t keep ladies’ goods.”</p>

<p>“No, for this young gentleman, my cousin,” she
added, looking at Harry.</p>

<p>“But, Maud, you mustn’t buy anything for me,”
interposed Harry, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall,” said Maud. “I don’t like your
cravat at all. I’m going to buy you a nice one.”</p>

<p>Harry continued to remonstrate, but he found that
opposition only made Maud more determined. So
he was obliged to submit, while she purchased for
him two handsome neckties.</p>

<p>“There, Harry,” she said, placing them in his
hand, as they left the shop, “I expect you to put one
of them on as soon as you get home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>“What will your father say, Maud?” asked
Harry. “Perhaps he won’t like it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know papa,” said Maud. “He will
only laugh. Now will you promise?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I am much obliged to you. I wish I
could buy you a present. Perhaps I may be able to
some time.”</p>

<p>“There, don’t say anything more about it. What
a lot of carriages there are in the street!—almost
as many as in London.”</p>

<p>The street, in fact, was lively with a continued
line of cabs, drays, and vehicles of various kinds,
presenting a spectacle more animated than might be
expected of a city of the size. But Melbourne,
though at this time it contained but a hundred thousand
inhabitants, had a very large foreign trade with
the principal ports not only of Europe but of the
United States. This had been largely increased by
the gold discoveries,—those who were lucky at the
mines being prodigal in their purchases of articles of
luxury as well as necessity. Then there was a large
export trade in wool, hides, and country produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
from the interior, especially in the two former, for
Australia is a great grazing country.</p>

<p>“I wonder what building that is!” said Harry,
soon afterwards.</p>

<p>He pointed to a very handsome structure in the
Italian style, on the corner of Bourke and Elizabeth
Streets. It was adorned with sculptures, and looked
new. In fact, it had just been opened to the public.</p>

<p>“That,” said a gentleman, who overheard him, “is
our new post-office.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” said Harry, “I must write
home to-night, to let my mother know where I am.”</p>

<p>In fact, Harry did write that same evening, and
gave the letter to a servant at the hotel to post. The
latter carelessly lost the letter, and then, being afraid
of blame, falsely assured Harry that he had posted it.
So the fates were once more against Mrs. Raymond,
and the missive which would have cheered her heart
got swept into a waste-basket, and was consumed
with other papers of no value.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">HARRY FORMS HIS PLANS.</span></h2>

<p>A week slipped away very pleasantly. Mr. Lindsay
was considerably occupied by business, but he
seemed satisfied to trust Maud to the companionship
of Harry. Together they went about the city sight-seeing.
They visited the several pleasure-grounds in
the immediate neighborhood of the city, among them
the Carlton and Fitzroy Gardens. Maud freely declared
that she had never had so good a time in her
life. Harry also enjoyed it; but every now and
then the thought would force itself upon him that he
ought to be doing something. At present he was
penniless, and but for the liberality of Mr. Lindsay
would have hardly known what to do. Besides this,
he felt that he ought to be earning money to get
home with. He could not help feeling anxious about
his mother and sister.</p>

<p>So one evening, after they had returned from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
excursion to the Yan Yean Water-works, about eighteen
miles distant from the city, Harry ventured to
ask an interview with Mr. Lindsay.</p>

<p>“Maud, you may go out a few minutes,” said her
father, “while Harry speaks with me.”</p>

<p>“He won’t mind me. Will you, Harry?”</p>

<p>“A little,” said our hero.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you had any secrets from me,”
said Maud, reproachfully.</p>

<p>“The secret is not a very great one,” said Harry.
“I may tell you afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Now, Harry,” said Mr. Lindsay, after Maud had
left the room.</p>

<p>“I wanted to consult you about my plans, Mr.
Lindsay,” said Harry. “I think I ought to go to
work.”</p>

<p>“Are you discontented?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; you and Maud have been very kind,
much kinder than I deserve. I don’t like to feel that
you are paying all my expenses.”</p>

<p>“In return, you relieve me of a good deal of care
by undertaking the charge of Maud. If I had not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
great deal of confidence in you, I would not be willing
to leave you together as much as I have.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for your confidence, Mr. Lindsay,”
said Harry. “I hope you will find that I deserve it.
I am glad if I have been able to make you any return
for your kindness. Still I cannot help feeling, for
my mother’s sake, that I ought to find something
to do, in order that I may return home as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p>“I might offer to pay your passage back to New
York,” said Mr. Lindsay; “but if I were in your
place, now that you are out here, I should wish to
stay a few months. You may never again have a
chance to visit Australia, and it is worth exploring.
You can write to your mother, so as to relieve her
from anxiety.”</p>

<p>“I have done so already,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“That’s well. Now have you any plans of your
own? If you have, and will state them, I will give
you my advice as to their wisdom.”</p>

<p>“I have been hearing a good deal of the gold
mines,” said Harry, “and I think I should like to
try my luck in them. Yesterday I saw a miner who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
had just returned to Melbourne, after working six
months. In that time he made ten thousand dollars,
which he brought with him. He is an American,
and means to return to New York by the next
steamer.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there are such cases of extraordinary luck;
but I hope you won’t be too sanguine, or you will, in
all probability, be disappointed. It is not every one
who earns even a thousand dollars in that time.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” said Harry. “Still, my chance
would be as good as any, and I might be lucky. At
any rate, I have nothing to lose, and should see
something of the country.”</p>

<p>“That is true. Well, when do you want to start?”</p>

<p>“I should like to start as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Let it be next Monday morning, then. I will
take care that you don’t go empty-handed.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you ought to give me so much, Mr.
Lindsay.”</p>

<p>“Leave me to decide that. Now shall we call in
Maud? I suppose she is tormented by curiosity to
know what we are talking about.”</p>

<p>“The reason I did not want to speak before her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
was, that I was afraid she would urge me not to go
away.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she will miss you very much; but we shall
expect to hear from you, and to see you again soon,
if only on a visit.”</p>

<p>As Harry anticipated, Maud strenuously opposed
his plan; but our hero felt that, however pleasant it
might be to remain, it was his duty to go. It was
of course very agreeable to enjoy the luxurious
accommodations of a first-class hotel; but all this
was not advancing him in life, and, however kind
Mr. Lindsay might be, he felt a degree of delicacy in
living at his expense.</p>

<p>Monday morning soon came. Mr. Lindsay called
Harry aside, and said:—</p>

<p>“My young friend, you will need some money to
start with. In this purse you will find fifty sovereigns
(about two hundred and fifty dollars in gold).
I think it will support you till you can earn something.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Lindsay,” said Harry, quite overwhelmed
by this munificent gift, “I ought not to
accept so much money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>“My young friend, when I was a boy, I met a
friend who took an interest in me, and helped me on.
I will try to do the same by you. I am a rich man
and can afford it. Say no more about it, but if you
need more, or get into any difficulty, let me know,
and I will do what I can to help you.”</p>

<p>Our hero clasped the hand of the generous merchant
warmly.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew how to thank you,” he said.</p>

<p>“You can do so, by justifying my good opinion of
you, Harry,” said Mr. Lindsay, kindly.</p>

<p>“I will try to do that at least,” said Harry, earnestly.
“I will never forget your generous kindness.”</p>

<p>That afternoon Harry started for the gold-diggings.
He did not go alone. He was fortunate enough to fall
in, at one of the hotels, with a man of middle age,
a rough-looking man to appearance, but, as Harry
afterwards discovered, a man of warm heart and
much kindness. This was the way the acquaintance
was made.</p>

<p>Harry overheard him speaking of the mines, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
which he said he had only recently returned. When
he had finished speaking, Harry said:—</p>

<p>“May I speak to you a minute, sir?”</p>

<p>“An hour if you like,” said the other, kindly.</p>

<p>“I wanted to ask you something about the mines.”</p>

<p>“Are you thinking of going there?” asked the
stranger, surveying him attentively.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“It is a rough sort of life you will have to lead
there, my boy.”</p>

<p>“I expect so, but I think I can rough it, for a time
at least.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you have good pluck I have nothing to
say. But it aint everybody that succeeds.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I suppose not; but I have a chance.”</p>

<p>“At any rate I have no right to dissuade you, for
I was successful.”</p>

<p>“Are you willing to tell me about it?”</p>

<p>“No objection at all. I was there four months.
In the first three I didn’t pay expenses, but in the
fourth month I more than made up for all my ill luck.
How much do you think I’ve got lodged with my
bankers here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>“A thousand dollars?”</p>

<p>“A thousand dollars seven times over. Eight
thousand dollars I cleared in that last month, and
seven of it I have salted down.”</p>

<p>Harry’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“I only wish I could be as fortunate,” he said,
earnestly.</p>

<p>“What would you do with your money then?”
asked the other.</p>

<p>“I would take care of my mother, and make her
comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about your mother, that is, if you don’t
mind. I’ve got nobody belonging to me, more’s the
pity, and perhaps that’s the reason why I like to hear
about other people’s relations.”</p>

<p>Harry thereupon began to relate his story, and,
assured by the stranger’s manner that he was interested,
kept on to the end.</p>

<p>“You’ve had bad luck, boy,” he said, at the end;
“but maybe it’ll turn out for the best. Perhaps you
have been sent to this out-of-the-way part of the
world on purpose to make your fortune. Who
knows?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish it might turn out so.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” said the stranger. “I
didn’t mean to go back to the mines. Seven thousand
dollars was enough for me; but I’ve a great
mind to go back with you.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” said Harry. “I’d like to go
with somebody that knows the mines, and can help
me with his advice.”</p>

<p>“I will go then,” said the other, emphatically.
“Now tell me when you want to go.”</p>

<p>“Next Monday.”</p>

<p>“That will suit me as well as any time. I’m
beginning to get tired of the city. There is nothing
to do here. There’s something in the wild, free life
of the mines that I like. It’s agreed then; we’ll go
together.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Harry, “and I am very glad that I
have secured company.”</p>

<p>“So am I. There’s no one out there that I cared
to make a friend of. It’s ‘every man for himself, and
devil take your neighbor.’ Perhaps I was as bad as
the rest. But I feel an interest in you, and whether
you find any gold or don’t find any, you’ll need a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
friend. Perhaps you’ll need one more if you are successful
than if you fail. What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Harry Raymond.”</p>

<p>“And mine is John Bush. I would give you my
card if I had any, but they don’t care about such
things at the mines. Will you take supper with
me?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you; I shall be expected back.”</p>

<p>“Have a cigar, then?”</p>

<p>“I never smoke, Mr. Bush.”</p>

<p>“So much the better, Harry. But it’s second
nature to me, and I can’t leave off. Let me see, what
day is it?”</p>

<p>“Friday.”</p>

<p>“Then Monday we will start. Call and see me
before that time.”</p>

<p>“I’ll call to-morrow afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Very good. We’ll arrange then all that needs
arranging.”</p>

<p>So they parted.</p>

<p>Bush, as Harry saw, was rather rough in his manners,
but he seemed kindly. He felt fortunate in
meeting him, for his advice would be valuable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
especially as he had been successful. Besides, as he
began to understand, the undertaking upon which he
was about to enter was one of difficulty and perhaps
danger, especially for one so young, and he would
be the better for a friend like Bush. He saw him
again, as promised, on Saturday, and got a list of
things which the miner informed him would be necessary.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE VICTORIA GOLD MINES.</span></h2>

<p>Four weeks had passed. The scene has changed
for Harry. He is no longer living in a first-class
city hotel on the fat of the land, but is “roughing it”
at the Victoria mines, seventy miles north-west of
Melbourne.</p>

<p>These diggings were of limited extent, occupying
not above a square mile; but this square mile was a
scene of extraordinary animation and activity. Scattered
over it were hundreds of miners, rough-bearded,
and clothed with little regard to taste or elegance.
They represented many countries, differing widely except
in being all occupied by one engrossing passion,
the love of gold. Some, rough as they now look, had
been gentlemen at home, fastidious in their dress and
personal appearance, but not to be recognized now,
so much were they changed. Others had always been
roughs, and this life which they were now leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
was little adapted to improve them. But it is not
necessary to speak of the mines in general. Our
interest is confined to two, and these two are of
course Harry and his adviser and friend John Bush.</p>

<p>At the moment of my introducing them once more
to the reader, Bush was seated upon the ground
smoking a pipe, while Harry was carefully inspecting
the back of a shovel, from which he had just been
washing some earth, in search of particles of gold.</p>

<p>“Do you find anything, boy?” asked Bush, taking
his pipe from his mouth.</p>

<p>Harry came nearer, that Bush might examine for
himself.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “there is a little.”</p>

<p>“It’s the only gold I have found to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, lad, we are not growing rich very fast,
that’s a fact. We’ve been at work more than three
weeks, and I don’t think we have netted five ounces.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Harry.</p>

<p>I may remark here that an ounce is worth not far
from twenty dollars. It follows accordingly that the
amount referred to represented less than a hundred
dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I have been thinking of,
Harry,” said Bush.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“I think our chances will be better further up the
hill. Here we may, if we are lucky, get three ounces
a week,—probably not as much. What I want is
a nugget.”</p>

<p>“But that isn’t so easy to find,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“No, that’s true; but they are found, for all that.
Shall I tell you what has made me think of it
most?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you will.”</p>

<p>Bush lowered his voice.</p>

<p>“Do you see that spot, about half a mile away,
where that rough, gray rock stands?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Three nights ago I dreamed that I found a big
nugget within a yard of that rock. Now, I never put
much faith in dreams; but I’ve had that same one
twice since.”</p>

<p>“You have?” said Harry, interested.</p>

<p>“Yes, and you know what they say, ‘the third time
never fails.’ I’m not over-superstitious, Harry, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
it’s my idea that dream means something. What do
you say?”</p>

<p>“It is very singular, at any rate,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“At any rate, I’ve a mind to see what it means,
if it means anything. So I’m going to leave you
here, and go up there. If I find nothing, well and
good, I’ll come back. If I’m lucky, we’ll share the
good luck. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“That you are very generous, Bush.” Harry had
come to call him so, for they are not very ceremonious
at the mines.</p>

<p>“Wait till you have something to thank me for.”</p>

<p>The next morning, accordingly, Harry was left
alone. He worked all day without meeting with
much success. All the gold he found probably would
not have amounted to fifty cents, and that was not a
very liberal compensation for the long and tiresome
labor needed.</p>

<p>At nightfall Bush came back.</p>

<p>“Well, Bush,” said Harry, “have you met with
any success?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Bush; “and I didn’t expect any, not
to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because it’s only the first day.”</p>

<p>“Still you might find something the first day.
Did you find nothing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a few grains of gold; but that I did not
care for. I’m after a nugget. You don’t understand
what I mean by the first day.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I had that dream three times, you know, Harry,”
said the miner, lowering his voice. “It’s impressed
on my mind that if I find anything it’ll be on the
third day.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will,” said our hero, who was impressed
by the evident earnestness of his companion.
“At any rate, I hope so.”</p>

<p>The next morning Bush left Harry, and returned to
the rock.</p>

<p>While Harry was at work, meeting with a little
more success than the day before, a rough fellow,
Henderson by name, lounged up to him.</p>

<p>“What luck, comrade?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not much,” said Harry. “I haven’t made my
fortune yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Henderson, emphasizing the declaration
with an oath. “I’ve had cursed bad luck all
along.”</p>

<p>This was not surprising, for Henderson was a lazy,
shiftless fellow, whose main idea was to make a
living without earning it. He had come from London,
where his reputation was none of the best, and
had haunted the mines for a considerable time. He
worked at mining by fits and starts, but never long
enough to gain anything. At one time, indeed, he
appeared to have considerable money, with which he
returned to Melbourne, where he soon got rid of it.
Where he got this money was a mystery. But it
happened, by an unfortunate coincidence, that just at
that time a poor fellow who, by hard labor, had managed
to collect about fifty ounces of the precious
metal, suddenly found himself stripped of everything.
There were some who suspected Henderson of knowing
something of this gold, and where it went to; but
nothing could be proved, and so of course nothing
was done. Harry had seen him more than once, and
he understood very well what sort of a character he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
was; so, at present, he hoped that the fellow would
soon leave him.</p>

<p>“Where’s your pal?” asked Henderson.</p>

<p>“You mean Bush?”</p>

<p>“Who else should I mean?”</p>

<p>“He’s trying another place.”</p>

<p>“Whereabouts?”</p>

<p>Harry pointed out Bush further up the hill. The
distance being but quarter of a mile, it was possible
to distinguish him.</p>

<p>“What sent the fool up there?”</p>

<p>“He is not a fool,” said Harry, shortly.</p>

<p>“Call him what you like; he’s a fool if he expects
to find anything up there.”</p>

<p>“He has his reasons,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“What are they?” inquired Henderson, growing
attentive.</p>

<p>“You must ask him if you want to know,” said
Harry.</p>

<p>Henderson went off whistling, and our hero, on
thinking the matter over, was rather sorry that he
had hinted as much about his friend’s reasons for
going up the hill. Having a very poor opinion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
Henderson, he feared that the latter would watch and
find out if anything of importance were discovered,
and this was hardly desirable in a district where the
ordinary restraints of law were relaxed, and cupidity
often led to violence. At any rate, Harry determined
to put Bush on his guard.</p>

<p>“Bush,” he said, when the latter returned, “Henderson
has been asking about you to-day. He
thought you were a fool to go up there after gold.”</p>

<p>“Let him think so if he likes.”</p>

<p>“But I am afraid you will think that I am the
fool.”</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“Because I told him you had reasons for going
there.”</p>

<p>“Just as well not said, my lad: but no harm’s
done.”</p>

<p>“Have you found anything yet?”</p>

<p>“No; but it’s only the second day, you remember.”</p>

<p>“You still think that the third day will be the
lucky one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if any.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, to-morrow will decide. If I don’t find any
thing to-morrow, I shall give it up for a bad job, and
come back.”</p>

<p>They had a tent just off the grounds. Here they
slept and lived, cooking their food, and keeping
house, if it may be called so. When the day’s work
was over, Bush generally sat down at the door of the
tent, and smoked a pipe. He tried to induce Harry
to do the same; but our hero had never touched
tobacco, and had no cravings for it. So he always
declined.</p>

<p>When the pipe was smoked, Bush, if he happened
to feel in a communicative mood, often related incidents
from his life, which had been an adventurous
one. To these narrations Harry always listened with
interest.</p>

<p>“I’ve been a rolling stone, Harry,” said his companion.
“It might have been different; but all that
belong to me are dead. There’s nobody I feel an
interest in except you. I’m going to keep track of
you, and when I die, if I leave anything, you shall
have it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t talk about dying,” said Harry. “Perhaps
you’ll live longer than I.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so; but I’m a deal older, my lad.
There’s more chance for you.”</p>

<p>Bush was a man in the prime of life, and Harry
built no hopes on this promise. He only thought
that it was very kind, and, it being his nature to
repay kindness with kindness, he felt drawn to his
rough companion more closely on learning of his
intention.</p>

<p>The next morning Bush returned to his digging on
the hill-side, and Harry continued at the same place,
meeting with a little success, but not much. However,
there were some who worked for months with
less encouragement, and finally met with a streak of
luck. So Harry did not lose hope, though he felt
that it was tantalizing and trying to the patience.</p>

<p>At nightfall Bush came back. Before he had come
up to him, Harry read in his excited look that something
had happened.</p>

<p>“What luck?” he asked.</p>

<p>Bush looked about him cautiously. There were
two men within hearing distance, so he lowered his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
tone. He only uttered five words, but they were of
such a character that Harry became no less excited
than he.</p>

<p>“<em>The dream has come true!</em>”</p>

<p>This was what he said, and Harry understood at
once.</p>

<p>“Let us go and take a walk, my lad.”</p>

<p>Harry eagerly complied with his invitation, and
they wandered away till they were out of earshot of
any one.</p>

<p>“Now tell me all about it,” said he.</p>

<p>“It was about the middle of the afternoon,” said
Bush; “the day was nearly gone, and I began to
think what a fool I was to place such dependence
upon a dream, even if it were three times repeated.
However, it was only the loss of three days, and that
wasn’t much; so little harm was done, if all came to
nothing. Of course I wasn’t going to give up till
the day was over. Just as I was thinking this, suddenly
I struck against something hard. I kept on,
not hoping much, till I brought out a nugget,—a
stunner, I tell you.”</p>

<p>“How much would it weigh?” asked Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hefted it,” said Bush, “and it doesn’t weigh an
ounce less than twenty-five pounds.”</p>

<p>Twenty-five pounds! Harry held his breath in
astonishment and delight. He performed a rough
calculation hastily in his head, and it dawned upon
him that the nugget must be worth at least five thousand
dollars!</p>

<p>That was pretty good for one day’s work.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DEATH OF BUSH.</span></h2>

<p>“Where is the nugget? What did you do with
it?” inquired Harry.</p>

<p>“I buried it in the spot where I found it,” said
Bush. “I didn’t dare to bring it here in open day.
There are worthless fellows enough hereabouts that
wouldn’t hesitate to take my life, for the sake of it.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t help its being found out that you
have it.”</p>

<p>“No more I can; but in an hour after it is known
I start for Melbourne.”</p>

<p>“Will you go to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lad, we will both go to-morrow. It’s
share and share alike, you know. Half the nugget is
yours, and if anything happens to me the whole, and
all the money I have in Melbourne.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Bush; but I’d rather you’d enjoy it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
yourself. I’d return the compliment, but I’m afraid
all the money I have wouldn’t help you much.”</p>

<p>“You’re young yet. There’s time enough for you
to become rich, as I doubt not you will.”</p>

<p>About half-past nine o’clock Bush and Harry threw
themselves down in the shadow of their tent, and
courted sleep. They did not take the trouble to undress,
but merely wrapped themselves in blankets
and lay down.</p>

<p>“I feel more sleepy than usual,” said Bush.
“Maybe it’s the excitement of finding the nugget.”</p>

<p>“That’s what keeps me awake,” said Harry.</p>

<p>As he spoke he began to listen intently.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Bush.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard somebody just outside.”</p>

<p>“Somebody passing on their way to their own
tent.”</p>

<p>“It may be so. I hope whoever it is didn’t hear
what you said about the nugget.”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t find it here, at any rate. Good-night,
Harry.”</p>

<p>“Good-night.”</p>

<p>Bush turned over, and it was not long before his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
deep breathing indicated that he was fast asleep.
Harry, on the contrary, was wakeful. He had a nervous,
restless feeling, as if something were going to
happen, though his forebodings were indefinite, and
took no decided shape.</p>

<p>At length he fell into a light slumber. How long
it lasted he could not tell. But all at once he awoke,
to find a man bending over Bush with a knife in his
hand. He uttered a cry of horror, and sprung to his
feet, but too late! The knife descended, penetrating
the breast of the ill-fated miner, who awoke with a
groan.</p>

<p>“Give me the nugget quick, boy, or I’ll serve you
the same way,” said the murderer, turning to Harry.</p>

<p>By the uncertain light Harry recognized Henderson.</p>

<p>“Wretch!” he exclaimed, in a tone of horror,
“what have you done?”</p>

<p>“There’s no time for talking,” said Henderson,
fiercely; “give me the nugget, or (here he interpolated
an oath) I’ll send you after Bush.”</p>

<p>He raised his knife, but Harry was too quick for
him. Fearing danger in some form, he had placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Bush’s revolver in his pocket when he lay down. He
drew it out suddenly, and, presenting it, fired. The
charge took effect in Henderson’s right shoulder.
With an oath he dropped the knife, and, staggering
out of the tent, fell just outside.</p>

<p>“Well done, my lad!” said Bush, feebly.</p>

<p>“Are you much hurt, Bush?” asked Harry, bending
over the sufferer, and speaking anxiously.</p>

<p>“He’s done for me, Harry. I shan’t live till
morning.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, Bush. Perhaps you’re not so
much hurt as you think for.”</p>

<p>“There’s no hope, lad. I’m going to die. I don’t
know why, but I had a presentiment that death wasn’t
far off.”</p>

<p>By this time the occupants of two neighboring tents
had come up. Seeing Henderson lying groaning just
outside, they entered and asked what was the trouble.</p>

<p>It was soon explained.</p>

<p>Now Bush was popular among the miners, and
Henderson the reverse, his character being thoroughly
understood.</p>

<p>“We’ll hang him to the nearest tree,” they said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait till to-morrow,” said Harry. “Then let
the whole company of miners decide what is to be
done.”</p>

<p>To this at length they assented, but cast glances
far from friendly at the prostrate wretch, with whose
groans of pain were now mingled appeals for mercy.</p>

<p>“Comrades,” said Bush, feebly, “come here a
moment, I’ve something to say.”</p>

<p>“Say on, Bush.”</p>

<p>“That wretch has killed me. To-morrow won’t
find me alive. That I know full well. Now I want
you to witness that this lad here is to have all I possess.
There’s a matter of fourteen hundred pounds
with Bird &amp; Bolton, bankers in Melbourne, and what
I have here the lad knows. He is to have all. Do
you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Bush.”</p>

<p>“I’ve paper and ink in my tent,” said one; “I’ll
bring them, and draw up a line to that effect, which
you shall sign if you can.”</p>

<p>“Do so, and quick,” said Bush.</p>

<p>In five minutes, the paper was brought, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
man who proposed this plan, after asking Harry’s
name, wrote as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I, John Bush, being about to die, bequeath to
Harry Raymond, here present, all that I have, namely,
fourteen hundred pounds in the hands of Bird &amp; Bolton,
bankers of Melbourne, and whatever I may leave
here.”</p></div>

<p>“I don’t know whether that’s ship-shape,” said the
writer; “but if you can sign it, we will witness it,
and I think it will do.”</p>

<p>The pen was placed in Bush’s fingers, and he succeeded
with some difficulty in affixing his signature,
after which he sank back exhausted. The three men
who had come up put down their names as witnesses,
or rather two of them did, and the third, who was
unable to write, made his mark.</p>

<p>“I’m glad that’s done,” said Bush, a smile of satisfaction
crossing his face. “I can die more content.
Give the paper to the lad.”</p>

<p>The paper was handed to Harry, who received it
with much emotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, Bush,” he said; “but I’d ten times
rather you’d live to enjoy this money yourself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it, lad; but it wasn’t to be. I hope
the money’ll give you pleasure. Then I can think
that I have done some good.”</p>

<p>The three men who had witnessed the paper next
turned their attention to Henderson.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with me?” he asked,
nervously.</p>

<p>“You’ll see in the morning,” said one, grimly.</p>

<p>He was securely bound, and carried to one of the
tents, where he was kept under secure guard. Meanwhile
Harry watched beside the suffering man.</p>

<p>“I wish there was a doctor near by,” he said.</p>

<p>“No doctor could do me any good now,” said
Bush. “I’ve got my death-wound.”</p>

<p>Indeed it seemed so. The knife had done its work
so surely that not all the doctors in the world could
have saved the miner from death. About four o’clock
in the morning he died. Then Harry, exhausted with
watching, fell asleep beside his dead comrade, and
slept heavily till he was aroused by a rough shake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked up, and recognized one of the three men
who had come to their tent the night before.</p>

<p>“Are you coming to see Henderson swing?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“We’ve tried him, and he’s to be hung as soon as
they can get a rope.”</p>

<p>Justice is swift in mining communities. It was
not yet seven o’clock in the morning, but the guilty
man had already been tried, and punishment was to
be inflicted.</p>

<p>Harry shuddered.</p>

<p>“No,” he said; “I don’t want to see it.”</p>

<p>“He killed your friend.”</p>

<p>“I know he did; but I pity the poor wretch. I
suppose he ought to be punished; but I don’t want to
see it.”</p>

<p>“You’re too soft-hearted; but just as you like.”</p>

<p>An impromptu gallows had been erected, and a
rope was soon forthcoming. Henderson was dragged
to it, pale and trembling, imploring mercy at every
step. But there was no mercy in the hearts of the
rough men who had him in charge. He had foully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
murdered one of their number, and they were determined
that he should pay the penalty. Among the
hundreds who participated in the scene, there were
others perhaps as reckless and criminal as he, who,
exposed to the same temptation, would have acted
in the same manner. But they, too, heaped execrations
upon the guilty man, as he cowered under the
gaze of the vindictive mob, and were apparently as
anxious as any that justice should be done. It might
have been from policy, but, at all events, Henderson,
as he glanced despairingly from one face to another,
did not encounter one kindly or pitying look. The
only one who pitied him was the boy whose friend
had been stricken down at his side, and he was not
present.</p>

<p>I shall not linger on the details of the execution.
No one of my readers, I am sure, can take pleasure
in such a scene.</p>

<p>Half an hour after, as Harry still lay in his tent,
a miner came to him.</p>

<p>“Is it all over?” asked Harry, sick at heart.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s all over. Henderson won’t prowl round
any more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>During the day Bush was buried. The funeral
ceremonies were slight. A grave was dug on the
hill-side, and the body was lowered down, and hastily
covered over. Harry procured a piece of board, which
he set up for a gravestone, cutting on its surface, as
well as he could, his friend’s name in rude capitals,—JOHN
BUSH.</p>

<p>He took into his confidence the three miners who
have been already spoken of, and told them about the
nugget, feeling that it might prove a source of danger
to himself as well as Bush, unless he availed himself
of the assistance of others. He offered to divide a
thousand dollars between them, if they would help
him to get it safe to Melbourne. He had another
reason also for desiring their company. They were
witnesses to the paper which Bush had signed, and
Harry thought it probable that their presence and
testimony might be needed to satisfy Bird &amp; Bolton,
first of the death of Bush, and next of his rightful
claim to the money belonging to the deceased, which
the firm had on deposit.</p>

<p>The three miners were quite willing to accompany
Harry. The sum which he offered them would probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
far exceed their earnings during the time occupied,
even after deducting all necessary expenses.
A day later, therefore, Harry, escorted by his three
mining acquaintances, with the costly nugget in
charge, started on his return to Melbourne.</p>

<span class="smaller">HARRY DECIDES TO LEAVE AUSTRALIA.</span></h2>

<p>“I wish Harry were here,” said Maud Lindsay,
discontentedly. “It’s so lonesome since he went
away.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, that is complimentary,” said her
father. “You don’t appear to value my company.”</p>

<p>“Of course I do, papa; but then you know you
are away a good deal of the time. Besides, you are
older than I am.”</p>

<p>“That is unfortunately true. I believe most
fathers are older than their daughters.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard from Harry yet?”</p>

<p>“Not since the letter of last week. He reported
then that he had not found much gold.”</p>

<p>“I wish he would make his fortune quick, so that
he could come back.”</p>

<p>“I begin to think you’re in love with Harry,
Maud.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>“I begin to think so too, papa. Would you object
to him for a son-in-law?”</p>

<p>“Just at present I might. I don’t think you are
old enough to be married.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be foolish, papa. Of course I don’t want
to be married till I am old enough.”</p>

<p>“I can’t promise so long beforehand. Besides, it
is just possible that Harry may have somebody
else.”</p>

<p>“I hope he won’t,” said Maud. “We just suit
each other.”</p>

<p>“You speak confidently, Maud. Perhaps you may
change your mind.”</p>

<p>“No, I shan’t,” said Maud, positively. “If I
don’t marry Harry Raymond, I’ll be an old maid.”</p>

<p>This conversation took place on the morning of
Harry’s return to Melbourne. Indeed, Maud had
hardly ceased speaking when a knock was heard at
the door. Maud rose to open it. She was overwhelmed
with delight when, in the visitor, in spite
of his rough garb, she recognized our hero, the loss
of whose company she had been deploring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>“O Harry, how glad I am to see you!” she
exclaimed, actually hugging Harry in her delight.</p>

<p>Harry was rather embarrassed at the unexpected
warmth of his reception, but felt that it would be
impolite not to kiss Maud in return, and accordingly
did so.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, Harry,” said Mr. Lindsay,
advancing to meet him. “Have you just arrived
from the mines?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I hope no ill luck has hurried you back.”</p>

<p>“Partly ill luck, and partly good luck. Bush
found a nugget of gold worth at least five thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p>“Then you had nothing to do with finding it?”</p>

<p>“We were partners, and he insisted that half of
it belonged to me.”</p>

<p>“That was generous. So you have come back to
dispose of it. Is Bush with you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Harry, soberly. “He is dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead! Why, that is sudden.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you about it.”</p>

<p>“Sit right down here, and tell me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry seated himself, and gave a brief account of
the murderous attack upon Bush, and his death, mentioning
in the conclusion that he was the heir of the
miner’s property.</p>

<p>“Let me see the paper,” said Mr. Lindsay.</p>

<p>Harry exhibited the paper signed by Bush just
before he died.</p>

<p>“Who are the witnesses whose names are written
here?”</p>

<p>“The three men who came up at the time of the
murder.”</p>

<p>“You will have to send for them to prove the
validity of this document, and satisfy the bankers
that you are the Harry Raymond to whom the money
is bequeathed.”</p>

<p>“They are here in Melbourne. I brought them
with me.”</p>

<p>“You are sharper than I thought. What made
you think of this?”</p>

<p>“I thought their testimony might be needed.
Besides, I was liable to be attacked, and perhaps murdered
on the way, if it were discovered that I had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
nugget; so I offered them a thousand dollars between
them, if they would come up with me.”</p>

<p>“It is a considerable sum, but I think you were
wise to pay it. I know these bankers with whom
your friend’s money is deposited. If you desire it, I
will take the matter in hand, and present your claim
at once.”</p>

<p>“That is what I wanted to ask, Mr. Lindsay. If
you will be so kind, I shall be very much obliged to
you.”</p>

<p>“Then we had better lose no time. I have an
hour to spare. Suppose you come with me now.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Maud, “I want Harry to stay with
me.</p>

<p>“Business first, pleasure afterwards, Maud,” said
her father; “and this business of Harry’s is of much
importance.”</p>

<p>“Well, Harry, come back as soon as you can,”
said Maud.</p>

<p>To this Harry readily agreed, and went out with
Mr. Lindsay.</p>

<p>Messrs. Bird &amp; Bolton were in their banking-office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr. Lindsay,” said Mr. Bird, as
that gentleman entered. “Is there anything I can
do for you this morning?”</p>

<p>“Not for me, but for this young man,” said Mr.
Lindsay, presenting Harry.</p>

<p>Mr. Bird looked at Harry in some surprise, for he
was still clad in his rough miner’s costume.</p>

<p>“You have fourteen hundred pounds left on
deposit by John Bush, a miner, if I am rightly informed.”</p>

<p>“Your information is correct, Mr. Lindsay.”</p>

<p>“John Bush is dead. This young man, whom I
previously knew, was his partner, and to him Bush
bequeathed all of which he died possessed.”</p>

<p>“I suppose your young friend has proof to substantiate
his claim,” said Mr. Bird, cautiously.</p>

<p>“He has.”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Lindsay produced the paper already
referred to.</p>

<p>“This seems correct, but the witnesses ought to
be produced. They might be men of straw, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Of course. In such a matter, you are right to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
cautious. The witnesses are all in Melbourne, and
shall be produced,” said Mr. Lindsay.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt all will be satisfactory; but of
course, as a man of business, Mr. Lindsay, you will
not be surprised that we require absolute proof.”</p>

<p>“You are perfectly right in doing so. I should do
the same in your place. We propose to bring the
witnesses here, that you may satisfy yourself that all
is genuine, and as it should be. If you will appoint
an hour that will suit your convenience they shall be
on hand.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow at eleven, then.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>After a little more conversation Mr. Lindsay and
Harry withdrew.</p>

<p>“There is one thing more that I would like your
advice about,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“What is that? Of course you shall have it.”</p>

<p>“I want to sell my nugget at the best advantage.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>“I will bring it to the hotel at any time. It is in
charge of the three miners.”</p>

<p>“You are rather careless to trust them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know but I am,” said Harry; “but I
didn’t know what else to do.”</p>

<p>“I will go around with you to the place where
they are stopping, and then will call with you upon
a man who deals in gold. The matter may as well
be settled at once.”</p>

<p>The three miners had put up at an inferior inn in
a narrow street running out of the principal avenue
in Melbourne. Luckily they were at home when
Harry called with Mr. Lindsay.</p>

<p>The latter found a certain reluctance on their part
to give up the nugget.</p>

<p>“You see,” said one, “this young chap has promised
us two hundred pounds between us. Maybe he
will forget all about that, and leave us to shift for
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I would be so mean?” exclaimed
Harry.</p>

<p>“The man is right,” said Mr. Lindsay. “He
wants to have everything made sure.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t pay them till the gold is sold.”</p>

<p>“That’s true; nor would it be advisable, for you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
want their testimony before the bankers. But I think
I see a way to arrange matters.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“I will advance one half the sum you promised at
once, and guarantee the payment of the balance
to-morrow afternoon, after they have rendered in their
testimony at the banking-house.”</p>

<p>This suggestion was accepted by all parties as the
best practical solution of the difficulty arising from
the conflicting interests of the two parties, namely,
the three miners on the one hand, and Harry on the
other. It must not be supposed that they had seen
anything in him to inspire distrust; but it is a good
rule to keep friendship and business apart, and
appearances are sometimes deceptive.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary to follow out the business
in all its details. There were some unexpected
delays; but at the end of a fortnight the whole
matter was settled, and Harry found himself, not
indeed rich, but richer than he ever anticipated.</p>

<p>The gold nugget was found to be worth five thousand
four hundred and fifty dollars. The money in
the banker’s hands, with accruing interest, amounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
to seven thousand and seventy-five. The account
was rendered in English currency, but for convenience’
sake I have reduced it to Federal money.
This, then, was the final statement of Harry’s inheritance:—</p>

<table summary="Statement of Harry’s inheritance">
  <tr>
    <td>On deposit with Bird &amp; Bolton,</td>
    <td class="tdr">$7,075.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sum realized from gold nugget,</td>
    <td class="tdr">5,450.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">Total,</td>
    <td class="tdr bt">$12,525.00</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>From this amount must be deducted the thousand
dollars which Harry agreed to pay to the three
miners. When this was done, he was left with
eleven thousand five hundred and twenty-five dollars,
which, for a boy of his age, was certainly a very
comfortable capital.</p>

<p>When this matter was settled, Harry began to
bethink himself of home, and told Mr. Lindsay that
he felt it his duty to go back to America as soon as
possible, and gladden his mother’s heart with the
news of his good fortune.</p>

<p>“You are right, Harry,” said Mr. Lindsay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
promptly. “Your first duty is to your mother. I
will not say a word to dissuade you from it.”</p>

<p>But if Mr. Lindsay forbore to dissuade Harry,
Maud was not so forbearing. She was exceedingly
dissatisfied at the idea of losing the society of our
hero.</p>

<p>“Why can’t we all sail in the same steamer,
papa?” she said.</p>

<p>“Because, Maud, I am not ready to go back yet.
My business is not finished.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall never see Harry again.”</p>

<p>“I think you will. I have invited Harry to visit
us in England next summer, and I think he will
accept the invitation.”</p>

<p>“Will you, Harry?” asked Maud, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I will if I can, Maud,” said Harry; “and I think
I can.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will forget me, Harry.”</p>

<p>“I certainly shall not, Maud. You have been too
kind for that. As soon as I get back to America I
shall write to you, and let you know how I arrived.”</p>

<p>Maud was forced to be satisfied with this promise.
Harry made all needed preparations for his return,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
and a week from the time when his affairs
were settled, he took cabin passage on a steamer
bound from Melbourne to New York. We must
precede him, and inquire how matters have been
going on in Vernon during his absence.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">SQUIRE TURNER SPINS HIS WEB.</span></h2>

<p>Harry’s disappearance inflicted a blow upon Mrs.
Raymond from which she did not easily recover.
Coming so soon after her husband’s sudden death, she
felt that her life had indeed become desolate, and
but that she knew her life was necessary to little
Katy, she would not have cared to live. But for
Katy’s sake she tried to bear up as well as she could
against her double loss.</p>

<p>Besides, so far as Harry was concerned, she was
not without hope that he might some day return. He
might be dead; but of this there was no proof. Mrs.
Raymond clung to the hope that, whatever might be
the cause of his absence, it was not occasioned by
death. But, in spite of this hope, it was hard to have
day after day pass without any intelligence. The
home seemed very lonely and sad now. Even little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
Katy, naturally a lively child, was subdued and
more sober than she used to be.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Raymond had another cause for anxiety,
and that a serious one. During her husband’s life she
had always lived in comfort, and never felt any anxiety
about the future. But now whatever money was
to be earned for the support of the little household
must be earned by herself, for of course Katy was too
young to earn anything, and must for some years be
kept at school. How to earn money enough to meet
their expenses was a difficult problem. She could
think of no other way except sewing, and that, even
under the best circumstances, as my readers very well
know, is very poorly paid.</p>

<p>Squire Turner occasionally called on Mrs. Raymond,
feeling that it was for his interest to assume
the role of a disinterested friend. One evening, about
six weeks after Harry’s disappearance, he took his
cane and walked over to the little cottage. The
widow had come to look forward with interest to his
visits, feeling in her position the need of a friend.
She welcomed him, accordingly, with an evident
pleasure, which he did not fail to notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope you are well, Mrs. Raymond,” he said,
removing his hat, and taking the chair which the
widow brought forward.</p>

<p>“I am well in health, Squire Turner,” was the
reply, “but, I am very unhappy. I sometimes feel as
if my sorrows are greater than I can bear.”</p>

<p>“You have Katy left.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Katy is a dear little girl. But for her I
should not care to live. But for her and the hope
that Harry may come back some time—”</p>

<p>“While there is life there is hope,” said the squire.
“I mean while we are not certain of death, there is
ground for hope.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you really think he will come back some
time, Squire Turner?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, there is a chance of it,” said the squire,
cautiously; “but it is not well to be too sanguine, for
you know we cannot be sure of anything.”</p>

<p>“If there was anything I could do,” replied the
widow; “but I can only wait, and the suspense is
very wearing.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I quite feel for you. Depend upon it,
I shall do what I can to relieve your anxiety whenever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
I see clearly what to do. You give me credit for
that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Squire Turner, I know you are a true friend.
The time was when I did you injustice; but I see
more clearly now.”</p>

<p>If Squire Turner had had any sense of shame he
would have blushed at this testimony from the woman
whom he had done so much to injure; but his feelings
were not very keen, and he only listened with
complacency, perceiving that he had made good progress
in securing the widow’s confidence. All his plans
seemed to be working well thus far. He was now
ready to take the next step, and this was to get Mrs.
Raymond into his power by placing her under pecuniary
obligations.</p>

<p>“I hope you will excuse me one question which I
am about to ask,” he said, “and believe that it is
dictated, not by idle curiosity, but my interest in your
welfare. Do you not feel considerable difficulty in
earning enough money to defray your expenses?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Raymond, “that is one of my
troubles. Katy and I have few wants; but I find it
costs a good deal for food, and fuel, and clothes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Especially as I have no way of earning except by
the needle. Sewing is very poorly paid.”</p>

<p>“That is quite true. By the way, Mrs. Raymond,
I shall be glad to give you all the work I have in that
line, and to pay you a fair price for doing it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Squire Turner. It will be a favor to
me.”</p>

<p>“And if you find you can’t meet your expenses,
don’t hesitate at any time to apply to me for a loan.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, Squire Turner, but I don’t
like to borrow money.”</p>

<p>“I can understand your feelings about it; but you
need not feel any delicacy.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I should never be able to repay the
money.”</p>

<p>“As to that, I can show you a way that will
relieve your feeling.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“You are aware that this house belongs to you,
with the exception of a mortgage of four hundred
dollars, which I hold. Now it is probably worth over
a thousand dollars,” he answered, courteously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Raymond considered it worth, with the land,
twelve hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“Ahem!” said the squire, who had his reasons for
underrating the property; “it was probably worth that
to him, but I don’t think it would fetch much over a
thousand, if it were brought to a sale. However, that
is not to the purpose. I only mentioned it to suggest
that the property might serve as ample security
for any sum you might wish to borrow, so that you
need not feel delicate about any loans you might be
forced to ask.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said Mrs. Raymond. “I did not
think of that.”</p>

<p>“Have you a supply of money on hand at present?”
asked the squire.</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond was forced to acknowledge that she
had less than a dollar in the house.</p>

<p>“I thought it might be so,” he said, “and therefore
I came provided. You had better let me lend
you fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>After some hesitation Mrs. Raymond consented to
take the money.</p>

<p>“If you will let me have a sheet of paper I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
draw up a note, which you can sign,” said the squire,
smoothly. “I know that it will be more agreeable to
your feelings to regard the loan as a business transaction
rather than as a favor.”</p>

<p>How could Mrs. Raymond feel otherwise than
grateful to the man who entered so delicately into her
feelings? She unhesitatingly acquiesced in what
he proposed, and brought forward writing materials,
with which Squire Turner drew up a note of hand,
which Mrs. Raymond signed. He then drew from his
pocket-book ten five-dollar bills, which he handed to
the widow, depositing the note in his wallet.</p>

<p>“There,” said he, pleasantly, “our business is at
an end, and now we can talk as friends. I believe
James is wanting some shirts. Shall you have leisure
to make them?”</p>

<p>“I shall be very glad to do so.”</p>

<p>“Then may I trouble you to buy the necessary
materials?—you will be a better judge than I on that
point. He will bring over one of his shirts as a pattern,
and you may make them up at your leisure, and
send in a bill for work and materials together.”</p>

<p>Of course Mrs. Raymond was only too glad to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
accept this commission, and readily agreed to do as
requested.</p>

<p>Squire Turner continued, as he had begun, to act as
a sympathizing friend of Mrs. Raymond. From time
to time he supplied her with money as she required
it, in each case, however, taking her note for the
amount, and, when the sum was sufficient to warrant
it, securing it by an additional mortgage upon the
property. When he proposed this, it was ostensibly
to spare the feelings of the widow, and prevent her
from feeling any delicacy or sense of pecuniary obligations.</p>

<p>“You see, Mrs. Raymond,” he said, smoothly,
“you have no cause to feel grateful to me. Every
pecuniary transaction between us is upon a strict
business basis. I know you would prefer that it
should be so.”</p>

<p>“I know that you are very kind, Squire Turner,
and I can’t help feeling grateful, though you tell me
there is no occasion for my being so.”</p>

<p>This is what Mrs. Raymond said, and she felt that
Squire Turner was indeed a very disinterested friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
though it would be hard to show in what respect he
had been so.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Squire Turner had kept in constant
correspondence with Mr. Robinson, the Milwaukie
lawyer, touching the land grant already referred to,
and it became necessary for him to obtain Mrs. Raymond’s
authority to act for her in the matter. It
was important for him to do this, without leading her
to suspect that it was a matter of much moment.
One evening he introduced the subject as if casually:—</p>

<p>“By the way, Mrs. Raymond, your son Harry
placed in my hands some time since a land warrant
belonging to your late father, with the request that I
would ascertain whether it was worth anything.”</p>

<p>“I remember it now that you mention it, Squire
Turner,” said the widow. “I suppose it is worthless.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the squire, candidly. “I think you
may get a little something for it. I suppose fifty or
a hundred dollars would be acceptable.”</p>

<p>“It would be more than I ever expected to realize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
from it. Do you really think it is likely to amount
to as much as that?”</p>

<p>“I really do,—that is, I hope so. If you are content
to give me authority to act for you, I will do the
best I can, and, of course, I shall charge you nothing
for my services.”</p>

<p>“How kind you are, Squire Turner! I will sign
anything you think best.”</p>

<p>“I have brought a paper properly drawn up, empowering
me to act for you,” said the squire. “I
will see that you have no trouble in the matter.”</p>

<p>Here he produced the paper, and Mrs. Raymond
unhesitatingly affixed her signature.</p>

<p>“I am sure,” she said, “I never expected, after so
many years, that the warrant would ever amount to
anything.”</p>

<p>“It may not, but I think it will. I will do my
best for you. In fact, I shall be obliged to go West
next week on some other business, and will take
Milwaukie on my way. I never was there, and, apart
from your business, I shall enjoy seeing the city.”</p>

<p>Was it surprising that Mrs. Raymond considered
Squire Turner a very disinterested friend? She felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
sure that he was putting himself to considerable trouble
and some expense to promote her interests. As
to that, it was certainly true that Squire Turner’s
sole motive, in making the western journey on which
he had determined, was connected with Mrs. Raymond’s
land warrant.</p>

<p>What success he met with will be told in the following
chapter.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">AN UNEXPECTED PROPOSAL.</span></h2>

<p>The next week Squire Turner started for Milwaukie.
He did not mention this as his destination in
the village, but stated that he had business in Chicago
and beyond, not caring to excite any suspicions in
Vernon, which was just large enough for everybody
to feel interested in everybody else’s affairs. But in
reality he stopped in Chicago only long enough to
take dinner, and then hurried on to Milwaukie, where
he proceeded at once to the office of Mr. Robinson.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you, Squire Turner,” said the
lawyer, rising from the table at which he was seated;
“the fact is, I was just thinking over your business.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is the prospect?” asked Squire
Turner.</p>

<p>“Excellent. The parties at first were disposed to
bluff me off, and pooh-pooh our claims; but they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
probably taken legal advice, and have changed their
tune in consequence.”</p>

<p>“Do they propose anything?”</p>

<p>“Yes; they offer five thousand dollars for the surrender
of the land warrant, which will insure them a
perfect title.”</p>

<p>“Five thousand dollars!” repeated Squire Turner,
slowly. “Of course, that is a good sum compared
with the original value of the warrant; but—”</p>

<p>“Small when the present value of the land is considered.
Precisely so.”</p>

<p>“What, then, would you advise?”</p>

<p>“I would advise you to hold off for more. You
are not in a hurry, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Not if you think it will pay to wait.”</p>

<p>“I do think so. If you are firm, it will argue a
consciousness of strength, which will produce an impression
on their minds.”</p>

<p>“How much do you think I ought to get?”</p>

<p>“Not less than ten thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Is there a chance of their coming up to that
figure?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should prefer friendly compromise to initiating
legal proceedings, even if I get less.”</p>

<p>Squire Turner had two reasons for this preference.
First, he knew well enough the delays of the law, and
that years might pass before the matter could be
settled, if once the law should be appealed to. But,
more than this, such a course would produce more or
less publicity, and Mrs. Raymond might hear of it,
which was very far from his wishes. But a compromise
could be effected without any public mention of
the affair, and this would be safer and more speedy.</p>

<p>“By the way, Turner, are you personally interested
in this matter?” asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the squire. “The claimant is a friend
of mine, and I have advanced money on it, considering
it a fair security. If she loses, I also become a
loser.”</p>

<p>This was not true, except indirectly, for, as the
reader knows, Squire Turner could only lose by being
obliged to forego his purpose of marriage.</p>

<p>“You have—excuse my inquiring—authority to
act in the matter?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I will exhibit it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>The squire drew out the document to which he had
obtained Mrs. Raymond’s signature, as described in
the preceding chapter. Mr. Robinson glanced at it.</p>

<p>“Quite correct,” he said. “Well, then, what shall
we decide?”</p>

<p>“Stand out for ten thousand dollars,” said the
squire. “I don’t mind a few months’ delay. In
fact, for some reasons, the delay will be satisfactory
to me.”</p>

<p>“If such are your views, we shall probably gain
our point,” said Mr. Robinson. “It will take some
time to bring up the parties to the point, but in six
months I think it can be effected, if we stand firm.
Will six months be too long?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. We will stand firm.”</p>

<p>The conversation now touched upon matters of
detail, on which we need not enter. It is enough to
say that Mr. Robinson and his client agreed upon the
policy advisable to be pursued, and the former agreed
to keep the latter constantly apprised of the progress
of the negotiation.</p>

<p>I must stop here to explain why it was that Squire
Turner was in no hurry to bring the matter to a conclusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
Nine months only had passed since Mr.
Raymond’s death, and an offer of marriage on his
part to Mrs. Raymond would, he felt, be considered
premature, and be very probably declined. Now, if
the matter were settled at once in favor of Mrs. Raymond,
she was liable at any time to be made aware
of it in some unforeseen way, and, if thus made
pecuniarily independent, the squire felt that she
would prefer not to contract a second marriage. He
counted upon obtaining her consent for the sake of
her child, whom he could support in comfort and
afford more advantages, which otherwise the mother
would be quite unable to provide. It therefore suited
his purposes better that the matter should be protracted
for, say six months, when a sufficient time
would have elapsed, since Mr. Raymond’s death, to
make his proposal proper.</p>

<p>Squire Turner returned from his western trip, and,
of course, took an early opportunity to call on Mrs.
Raymond.</p>

<p>“Did you have a pleasant journey?” asked the
widow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very. By the way, I stopped at Milwaukie on
my return.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything of the warrant?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I find there is a chance of realizing seventy-five
or a hundred dollars from it. It is not much,
to be sure—”</p>

<p>“It will be a good deal to me. You are certainly
very kind, Squire Turner. You must deduct any
expenses which you have incurred about it.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t think of it, Mrs. Raymond,” said the
squire, in a cordial manner. “It is a pleasure to me
to serve my friends.”</p>

<p>“How much I have misjudged Squire Turner in
times past!” thought Mrs. Raymond, and she
thanked him again.</p>

<p>Two months later Squire Turner received a letter
from the Milwaukie lawyer, in which he stated that
the parties had increased their offer to seven thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>“Shall I accept it for you?” he asked.</p>

<p>Squire Turner replied that the offer was not satisfactory,
and that the negotiation must proceed. He
was in no particular hurry, he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>A month later the offer was increased to eight
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>“Tell them,” he wrote, “that we will take a month
to consider their offer. I am not in haste, as I before
wrote, and am resolved not to accept any sum short
of ten thousand dollars. Still it won’t do any harm
to appear to consider their offer.”</p>

<p>So negotiations continued until the six months had
nearly passed. It seemed pretty clear now that
Squire Turner’s ultimatum would shortly be accepted,
nine thousand dollars having been already
offered. Mr. Robinson advised his client to come
out to Milwaukie, feeling confident that, if he were
personally present, the matter could be satisfactorily
arranged on his own terms. To this the squire was
not averse; but first he wished to see what were his
chances of success with the widow.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he dressed himself with more than
usual care, one evening, and walked round to the
house of Mrs. Raymond. He had become such a
frequent visitor there, of late, that his visits never
excited surprise.</p>

<p>He was received with the usual welcome. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
Raymond ushered him into the sitting-room, where
she had been sitting with little Katy. Katy was
reading a book which she had taken from the Sunday
school library. Squire Turner looked at her and hesitated,
for he did not care to have the little girl present
when he made his proposal.</p>

<p>“Have you heard anything from Milwaukie, Squire
Turner?” asked the widow.</p>

<p>“Not very recently. I don’t doubt, however, that
matters will turn out favorably. In fact, I am so
confident, that I am quite willing to advance you
fifty dollars on the warrant.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Squire Turner; but just at present I
have a little money on hand. I am glad you think I
shall get it.”</p>

<p>“I feel sure of it.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause, and then he proceeded:
“There is a matter about which I would
like to speak to you alone, Mrs. Raymond, if you
would be willing to send Katy out of the room for a
few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Katy, you may go upstairs for a little
while.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>Katy left the room, and Squire Turner found himself
alone with the widow. He drew his chair a little
nearer and commenced:—</p>

<p>“I am about to make you a proposal, Mrs. Raymond,
which I think will be mutually advantageous,
and I hope you will regard it in that light. I have
had it in view for some time, but felt delicate about
introducing the subject before. I hope you regard
me as a friend.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, you have been a true friend to me, Squire
Turner.”</p>

<p>“I have tried to be,” said the squire, modestly.
“But I will not waste time, but at once make my
proposal. You have lost your husband, I my wife.
I need some one to superintend my house, and look
after my son, while you need a protector who is able
to give you a good home. Will you be my wife?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Squire Turner,” said Mrs. Raymond,
startled, “I never anticipated that your proposal
would be of such a character.”</p>

<p>“And yet, why should you be surprised? Need
I recall that time, years since, when we were both
younger, and I made the same offer? You see my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
attachment is no new thing. You preferred another,
but he has been taken from you.”</p>

<p>“I thank you very much for your kind offer,” said
Mrs. Raymond, “but I have never thought of marrying
again since husband’s death. I do not
think it would be right.”</p>

<p>“Such marriages take place continually.”</p>

<p>“I know they do; but all do not feel as I
do.”</p>

<p>“I think your late husband would favor it. Think
of your dependent condition. You have hard work
to earn a poor living, and when the four hundred
dollars which remain to you are gone, you will indeed
be in a different position.”</p>

<p>“That is true.”</p>

<p>“Consider, on the other hand, that I could give
you a good home at once, and relieve you from all
pecuniary anxiety. Your little Katy needs better
advantages than you can give her. She seems to
have a taste for music. I should have her at once
commence lessons on the piano, and would take care
that she should receive as good an education as money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
could procure. For her sake, Mrs. Raymond, I hope
you will reconsider your decision.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond had often lamented her inability to
have Katy properly educated, and the squire could
have used no argument more potent.</p>

<p>“If I thought it would be right,” said the widow,
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Think what a difference it will make in Katy
half a dozen years hence. Of course, if I am personally
disagreeable to you—”</p>

<p>“No, no, my kind friend; do not think that,”
said Mrs. Raymond, hastily. “But I do not know
what to say. The proposal is so new and unexpected
that I cannot make up my mind at once what it is
right for me to do.”</p>

<p>“I will not ask you to decide at once. Take three
days for it, and if you have any friend whom you
trust, ask that friend’s advice. Will you do so?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the widow, “I will do as you advise.
I will think over your proposal, and I will try to
decide in three days’ time.”</p>

<p>“Then I will call on Tuesday to receive your
decision. Let me hope it will be favorable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>Squire Turner left the cottage in a satisfied frame
of mind. He felt sure that for Katy’s sake Mrs.
Raymond would accept him.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.<br />
<span class="smaller">IN WHICH TWO STRANGERS PUT IN AN APPEARANCE.</span></h2>

<p>Mrs. Raymond consulted with a friend, according
to Squire Turner’s suggestion, and was advised by all
means to accept.</p>

<p>“It will be such an advantage for Katy, you
know,” her friend said.</p>

<p>“But I don’t feel as if it would be quite right. I
don’t love Squire Turner.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to. People don’t often marry a
second time for love. That will do very well for a
young girl; but there are other things to be thought
of now.”</p>

<p>“Then you advise me to marry again?”</p>

<p>“I do, most certainly.”</p>

<p>“If Harry were at home I would not do it,” said
the widow. “I don’t think he would like it. As it
is, it is only for Katy’s sake that I give my consent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>So when Squire Turner called for his answer he
found it to be favorable. He urged immediate marriage.
For this he had his reasons, as he desired to
be in a situation to complete his western negotiation.</p>

<p>“There is no use in delaying,” he said. “The
sooner Katy commences her musical education the
better. Besides, I am lonely, and my household
sadly needs a woman to look after it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Raymond would have preferred to postpone
the marriage for six months; but she could assign no
reasons for it, and so at length yielded to the squire’s
request, and that day four weeks was appointed for
the wedding. The next day Squire Turner went to
the city, and selected a handsome silk dress-pattern,
which was forwarded by express to Mrs. Raymond,
with an intimation that it was for her wedding-dress.
She could not do otherwise than accept it, and the
village dress-maker was sent for at once to superintend
its making up.</p>

<p>Time slipped by, and the day for the marriage had
nearly arrived. The wedding-dress was completed,
and various other articles, which had also been sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
through the squire’s liberality, lay upon the bed in
Mrs. Raymond’s chamber.</p>

<p>“What a beautiful dress, mother!” said Katy.
“I wish you would try it on.”</p>

<p>More to please the little girl than herself, Mrs.
Raymond consented and tried on the new dress.
She was still a fine-looking woman, as I have already
said, and the new dress became her well. Little
Katy looked at her in admiration, and said, “How
beautiful you look, mother! I wish Harry were
here to see you.”</p>

<p>At the sound of Harry’s name Mrs. Raymond’s
face changed. She could not conceal from herself
that what she was about to do would have been
strongly opposed by Harry, had he been at home.
Would he ever come home? That was the question
which occurred to her, and, if he did, what would he
say to find her Squire Turner’s wife?</p>

<p>“I wish I could put it off for six months,” she
thought.</p>

<p>They were in a room on the second floor, and there
was no one in the lower part of the house. Just then
the front door was heard to open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go downstairs, Katy,” said Mrs. Raymond.
“Somebody has come in. See who it is, and come
and tell me.”</p>

<p>Katy went down, and directly Mrs. Raymond
heard a loud exclamation. She could not exactly
make it out, but it sounded like “Harry!” A wild
hope sprang up in her heart. Without thinking of
her bridal dress she hurried downstairs. She was
not deceived. There stood Harry, her Harry, taller
and manlier than when she saw him last, but with
the same frank, handsome face, holding his little
sister in his arms.</p>

<p>“Harry!” exclaimed Mrs. Raymond, in joyful
surprise; and in a moment the long-separated son
and mother embraced.</p>

<p>“God be thanked for your return, my dear son!”
she said. “Where have you been all this long
time?”</p>

<p>“It will take a long time to tell, mother. I have
just returned from Australia.”</p>

<p>“From Australia!” exclaimed Mrs. Raymond, in
amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, it’s a long story. I will tell it by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
and by. But how well you are looking! And (for
the first time noticing his mother’s elegant dress) how
handsomely you are dressed! Have you come into
a fortune since I went away?”</p>

<p>“No, Harry,” said Mrs. Raymond, confused.</p>

<p>“I expected to find you in poverty, perhaps in
want,” said Harry, puzzled more and more. “I
didn’t think to see you dressed like a queen.”</p>

<p>“It’s mother’s wedding-dress, Harry,” said little
Katy, who did not share her mother’s embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Your wedding-dress, mother!” exclaimed Harry,
his face clouding. “Who are you going to marry?”</p>

<p>“I did it for the best, Harry,” said his mother,
uneasily; “and he has been very kind.”</p>

<p>“Who is he, mother?”</p>

<p>“Squire Turner. He—”</p>

<p>“Squire Turner!” exclaimed Harry, vehemently,
springing to his feet; “it is not possible you are
thinking of marrying him. He is the worst enemy
we have.”</p>

<p>“No, Harry,” said his mother; “you are mistaken
there. You must, at least, do him justice. He has
been very kind, very kind, indeed. I don’t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
how I should have got along, in the sad days after
we lost you, but for his kindness.”</p>

<p>“So you think he has been kind, mother?” said
Harry, with a peculiar expression.</p>

<p>“Very kind, as Katy can tell you,” said Mrs. Raymond.
“Not that this is reason enough to marry
him. But it is for Katy’s sake I am going to do it.
Squire Turner has promised to give her every advantage,
and she will begin to take music-lessons as
soon as we are married. I have had very hard work
getting along, Harry, and it was a relief to feel that
I need have no more anxiety about making a living.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t love him, mother?”</p>

<p>“I shall never love any one again, Harry. My
love was buried in your father’s grave.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of that, at any rate; glad that you
don’t love this scoundrel—”</p>

<p>“Harry, Harry, don’t talk so, I beg of you.”</p>

<p>“Mother, I have good reason for all I say. I
know Squire Turner better than you.”</p>

<p>“How can you know him so well, when you have
been away for more than a year?”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea why I went away so suddenly?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
I don’t mean to New York; but how it happened
that I disappeared from New York?”</p>

<p>“No, Harry, I know nothing of it.”</p>

<p>“Then I will tell you. Squire Turner, whom you
think so kind, had me kidnapped on board a vessel
bound for China, and I started on my long voyage
without any chance of letting you know what had
become of me.”</p>

<p>“This is a strange story, Harry. Are you sure of
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I have proof of it. I did not suspect at
first that Squire Turner had anything to do with the
matter, till one day, in the cabin, I picked up a letter
directed to Captain Brandon by Squire Turner, which
made it all clear.”</p>

<p>“But what interest could Squire Turner have in
getting you out of the country?” asked Mrs. Raymond.</p>

<p>“I think I know of a reason, mother,” said Harry;
“but I don’t care to mention it now.”</p>

<p>“You said the vessel was bound for China. How,
then, did you get to Australia?”</p>

<p>“I was thrown into the sea,” said Harry; “and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
after floating about for many hours, was picked up at
length by a vessel bound for Australia.”</p>

<p>“You have, indeed, encountered great perils, my
dear son,” said his mother, shuddering. “Thank
God, you escaped them all, and are once more restored
to us.”</p>

<p>Harry was about to question his mother more particularly
respecting her trials during his absence,
when a knock was heard at the door.</p>

<p>“I will open it, mother,” said Harry.</p>

<p>Opening the front door he saw on the step a well-dressed
gentleman, whom he did not recognize.</p>

<p>“Does Mrs. Raymond live here?” asked the
stranger.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Would you like to see her?”</p>

<p>“I should like to do so. I am managing some
business for her.”</p>

<p>Here he offered his card, which bore the name:—</p>

<p class="center">“FRANCIS ROBINSON,<br />
“<i>Attorney at Law</i>,<br />
“<span class="smcap">Milwaukie</span>.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you walk in, sir?” said Harry, considerably
surprised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is my mother,” he said, introducing the
lawyer. “Mother, this is Mr. Robinson, of Milwaukie,
who says he is attending to some business there
for you.”</p>

<p>“Will you be seated, sir?” said Mrs. Raymond.
“I had not heard your name, but I suppose it’s
about the land warrant.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam. I am glad to say that we have
succeeded. I happened to be called East on business,
and thought I would call in person, and communicate
the favorable termination of our negotiation.
I went first to the house of Squire Turner; but, learning
that he is out of town for a day or two, inquired
you out, and have great pleasure in being the first to
impart the good news to you.”</p>

<p>“May I inquire,” said Harry, “how much my
mother is likely to realize for the land warrant?”</p>

<p>“The other party have agreed to your terms.
They will compromise without an appeal to law,
agreeing to pay ten thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“Ten thousand dollars!” repeated Mrs. Raymond,
in bewilderment. “Surely there is some mistake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
Squire Turner told me I might realize from seventy-five
to a hundred dollars from it.”</p>

<p>“Seventy-five to a hundred dollars!” he repeated.
“Are you sure you understood Squire Turner
aright?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. He told me only a fortnight since
that he thought I would obtain this sum, and I felt
lucky to get anything at all.”</p>

<p>“There is a great mistake somewhere,” said the
lawyer, significantly. “Of one thing, however, I
can assure you,—that the ten thousand dollars will
actually be paid.”</p>

<p>“Mother,” said Harry, “have you given Squire
Turner authority to act for you in this matter?”</p>

<p>“I have,—that is, I signed a paper which he said
gave him such authority.”</p>

<p>“He showed me that paper,” said Mr. Robinson.</p>

<p>“Can my mother revoke that authority?” asked
Harry.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly.”</p>

<p>“Then she does revoke it at once,—am I not
right, mother?”</p>

<p>“If you think best, Harry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>“I do think best. It is evident that Squire Turner
has not been faithful to your interests. If you
wish, I will act as your agent.”</p>

<p>“But you are so young, Harry.”</p>

<p>“I have seen something of the world, mother,
since I left home. I shall not hesitate to take charge
of the business. Mr. Robinson will assist me.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I shall be happy to do whatever I
can.”</p>

<p>“Then, Mr. Robinson, if it would not be too much
trouble, and you can spare the time, will you give me
a history of the case, and explain how matters at
present stand?”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the lawyer, smiling, “that you know
how to come to the point. I will endeavor to imitate
you.”</p>

<p>He made a brief and comprehensive statement,
which Harry readily understood.</p>

<p>“Have you the warrant, Mr. Robinson?” asked
our hero.</p>

<p>“Yes; it was committed to me by Squire Turner.”</p>

<p>“That is all right. I was afraid he had it in his
possession, and that might give us trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>“No; it is out of his power to affect the arrangements
already made.”</p>

<p>“How long shall you remain East, Mr. Robinson?”
asked Harry. “I shall wish to see you again.”</p>

<p>“I shall remain in New York a week, my head-quarters
being at the Astor House.”</p>

<p>“I will call upon you there. Meanwhile, we leave
this matter entirely in your hands.”</p>

<p>Mr. Robinson was about to go, when little Katy,
who had been looking out of the window, suddenly
exclaimed:—</p>

<p>“Mother, I see Squire Turner coming up the road.
I think he is coming here.”</p>

<p>All present looked at each other in momentary
doubt as to what was best to be done. Harry was
the first to grasp the situation.</p>

<p>“Mr. Robinson,” he said, “will you be kind
enough to accompany me to another room, and wait?
I would like your presence by and by. Mother,
while you are upstairs and changing your dress,
Katy will admit Squire Turner, and tell him you will
be down directly. Mind, Katy, not a word about my
having got home, or about Mr. Robinson’s being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
here. When you come down, mother, you must tell
Squire Turner that you have changed your mind
about marrying him, and, if he makes any objection,
call me in.”</p>

<p>“I see you are a master of strategy, my young
friend,” said Mr. Robinson, smiling. “I place myself
unhesitatingly in your hands.”</p>

<p>Harry’s programme was instantly carried out, and
one minute later Squire Turner knocked at the door
of the cottage.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>

<p>“Is your mother at home, Katy?” asked Squire
Turner, as the child opened the outer door.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Katy. “She’s upstairs.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell her I wish to see her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Squire Turner walked in, and took a seat without
ceremony, as was natural, considering that it was the
house of his future wife. Katy went upstairs, and
presently Mrs. Raymond, who had changed her dress,
came down.</p>

<p>“I thought you were out of town,” she said, trying
to speak in her usual manner, but succeeding with
difficulty, for she could not help thinking of the
squire’s agency in driving Harry from home.</p>

<p>“I returned sooner than I anticipated. By the
way, I think I have found a tenant for this cottage.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that will be necessary, Squire Turner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
I shall probably continue to occupy it myself.”</p>

<p>“How can that be?” demanded the squire, surprised.
“As my wife, you will, of course, live in my
house.”</p>

<p>“I shall not become your wife. I have changed
my mind.”</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” he demanded, angrily.
“Why do you trifle with me thus?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid, Squire Turner, you have not been so
much my friend as I supposed.”</p>

<p>“In what respect have I failed to act as your
friend?”</p>

<p>“O Squire Turner!” exclaimed the widow, impulsively,
“how could you contrive such a wicked plot
against my poor boy? How could you send him to
sea, and not tell me, when you saw I was breaking my
heart at his absence?”</p>

<p>The squire flushed at this unexpected accusation.
How in the world, he thought, could Mrs. Raymond
have heard of his agency in the abduction of Harry?</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” he said; but his
face belied his words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was wicked,” said Mrs. Raymond, “to endanger
his life and rob me of happiness!”</p>

<p>“Who makes this absurd charge against me?”
demanded the squire.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Harry entered.</p>

<p>“Squire Turner,” he said, “I don’t suppose you
are very glad to see me. Probably you did not
expect me home so soon; perhaps not at all.”</p>

<p>“Where did you come from?” stammered the
squire.</p>

<p>“From Australia.”</p>

<p>“From Australia—I thought—”</p>

<p>“Yes, you thought I was bound to China,” said
Harry, coolly. “But I left the Sea Eagle, not liking
Captain Hartley Brandon very much, and went to
Australia instead.”</p>

<p>This was a surprise to the squire, who answered,
doggedly, however, “You seem to be laboring under
a strange mistake, Harry. What possible motive
could I have for sending you away?”</p>

<p>“I can think of one,” said Harry, significantly;
“but perhaps you would not like to have me mention
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the squire’s face flushed, for he comprehended
the allusion very well. He turned to Mrs.
Raymond.</p>

<p>“Am I to understand, Mrs. Raymond,” he said,
“that you break your engagement to me?”</p>

<p>“I should hardly expect to marry you now, after
all that has happened.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the squire, angrily, “I may as well
go; but, before going,” he added, with a sneer, “I
congratulate you on securing a new dress at my
expense.”</p>

<p>“How is this, mother?” asked Harry.</p>

<p>“Squire Turner gave me my wedding outfit,” said
the widow, embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Don’t let that trouble you, mother,” said Harry.
“Squire Turner, if you will let me know the expense
which you have incurred, I shall have pleasure in
paying the bill.”</p>

<p>“I think you will have a little difficulty in paying
a hundred and twenty dollars,” sneered the squire.</p>

<p>In reply, Harry drew out his pocket-book and took
therefrom a hundred-dollar bill and a twenty, and
laid them on the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think you will find that correct,” he said.</p>

<p>“Where did you get all this money?” the squire
asked, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“My voyage turned out better than you anticipated,”
said Harry. “If you still hold a mortgage
on this house, I will take it up whenever you desire.”</p>

<p>It is hard to say whether Squire Turner was more
pleased at getting back his money, or disappointed
at the intelligence of Harry’s good fortune; but, on
the whole, it is safe to say that the latter feeling predominated.</p>

<p>He took the bills, and again took his hat to go,
when he was stopped by Harry.</p>

<p>“If you will stay five minutes longer,” he said,
“I should like to ask you one or two questions. My
mother tells me that you have been trying to obtain
money for the land warrant I placed in your hands.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the squire.</p>

<p>“May I ask what success you have met with?”</p>

<p>“Probably she will realize a hundred dollars from
it.”</p>

<p>“On the whole, Squire Turner, we will not trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
you to do anything more about it. I think I can do
better than that.”</p>

<p>“I have your mother’s authority to act as her
agent. You are a boy, and not competent to manage
it.”</p>

<p>“My mother recalls her authority.”</p>

<p>“Is this true?” demanded the squire, hotly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the widow. “Now that Harry is at
home, I think he can attend to it.”</p>

<p>“Then you won’t realize a cent,” snapped the
squire. “But you can’t blame me. I have been
doing my best for you, and that is all the thanks I
get. I shall now charge you with the expenses I
have incurred in the matter, though I did not intend
to do so.”</p>

<p>“If the bill is a fair one it shall be paid,” said
Harry.</p>

<p>He went to the door and called “Mr. Robinson!”
That gentleman entered. Squire Turner looked at
him as if he could not believe the testimony of his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Robinson!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the lawyer; “I was called East, unexpectedly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
and thought I would make a call on you to
report progress. Not finding you at home, I inquired
out Mrs. Raymond, who, by the way, I found
had an entirely erroneous idea of the value of the
warrant. You will be glad to know that I have succeeded
in obtaining an offer of ten thousand dollars,
which will be paid over within a month.”</p>

<p>This last blow was too much for Squire Turner.
Foiled at all points, he dashed his hat angrily upon
his head, and rushed from the house in undignified
haste. In this connection, it may be added that
Harry, finding he had collected the two thousand dollars
from the insurance company, forced him to return
it. Squire Turner saved his reputation by stating
that the man who set the house on fire had voluntarily
come forward and paid the money, which enabled
him to return the sum collected of the company.
For this act Squire Turner was made the subject of a
complimentary paragraph in the county paper; but it
is doubtful if he enjoyed reading it much.</p>

<p>Great was Mrs. Raymond’s joy over the lucky turn
in her affairs. Between nine and ten thousand dollars
were paid her as the proceeds of the land warrant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
and this made her quite comfortable. When it
was ascertained that Harry had brought a still larger
sum from Australia, he became quite a great man in
Vernon, and, if he had not been so young, I verily
believe he would have been elected to some responsible
town office.</p>

<p>But it was not Harry’s intention to live in Vernon.
He wanted a larger field for his efforts. The next
summer he made a visit to England, and was cordially
received by Mr. Lindsay, who wished him to
remain; but Harry was unwilling to be separated
from his mother. Mr. Lindsay then proposed to
Harry on his return to enter a counting-room in New
York, to learn business, with a view of establishing a
branch of his own house in that city, at a later day, to
be under Harry’s charge. This proposal was accepted
by our hero, who felt that it would be advantageous
to him. He removed his mother and sister
to New York, as they were unwilling to be separated
from him.</p>

<p>It is enough to say that in business Harry exhibited
the same qualities which we have already seen
in him, and that his mastery of the details was surprisingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
rapid. As I write, Harry, who is now
twenty-one, is about to undertake the charge of the
New York branch of Lindsay &amp; Co., which will give
him a commanding business position. There are
rumors that Maud, whose early preference for him
still continues, will, before very long, become the
wife of her father’s young American representative,
and I am inclined to think the report is a true
one.</p>

<p>My readers may like to hear how James Turner
made out in life. A year since he obtained the situation
of teller in a bank, his father standing surety
for him. He soon developed expensive tastes, and
finally disappeared, carrying away thirty thousand
dollars of the funds of the bank. This loss his
father has had to make good, and, in consequence, he
has become a comparatively poor man, and a very
sour, morose man at that. He was compelled to give
up his imposing house, and he now lives in the humble
cottage formerly occupied by Mrs. Raymond. So
the wheel of fortune has turned, and those who were
once at the top are now at the bottom. But, for
Harry and his mother, we hope many years of happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
are in store. But, if ever reverses should come,
we are sure that Harry, keeping in mind his old
motto, “<span class="smcap">Sink or Swim</span>,” would bear up bravely, and
turn defeat into victory.</p>

<p class="center larger">HORATIO ALGER, JR.</p>

<p>The enormous sales of the books of Horatio Alger,
Jr., show the greatness of his popularity among the
boys, and prove that he is one of their most favored
writers. I am told that more than half a million copies
altogether have been sold, and that all the large circulating
libraries in the country have several complete
sets, of which only two or three volumes are ever
on the shelves at one time. If this is true, what thousands
and thousands of boys have read and are reading
Mr. Alger’s books! His peculiar style of stories, often
imitated but never equaled, have taken a hold upon the
young people, and, despite their similarity, are eagerly
read as soon as they appear.</p>

<p>Mr. Alger became famous with the publication of
that undying book, “Ragged Dick, or Street Life in New
York.” It was his first book for young people, and its
success was so great that he immediately devoted himself
to that kind of writing. It was a new and fertile
field for a writer then, and Mr. Alger’s treatment of it
at once caught the fancy of the boys. “Ragged Dick”
first appeared in 1868, and ever since then it has been
selling steadily, until now it is estimated that about
200,000 copies of the series have been sold.—“Pleasant Hours for Boys and Girls.”</p>

<p>A writer for boys should have an abundant sympathy
with them. He should be able to enter into their
plans, hopes, and aspirations. He should learn to look
upon life as they do. Boys object to be written down to.
A boy’s heart opens to the man or writer who understands
him.—From “Writing Stories for Boys,” by Horatio Alger, Jr.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
